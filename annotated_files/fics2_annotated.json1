He\n must have been in Hell.  It figured.\n He heard a noise to his right.  Picard looked in that direction sharply.  He\n could make out a form struggling to get up.  “Ughh.”  It sounded like Commander\n Riker.\n “Will?” Picard said.\n “Captain?” Riker answered.\n Picard felt around the back of him.  He felt a chair, with the same creaks\n and crevices of… the command chair on the Enterprise.  He must not have been in\n Hell after all.  Somehow, the Enterprise had survived the shock wave.  “Number\n One, we must restore at least partial power.”     “What I don’t understand is,”\n Riker said, standing up, “why Starfleet didn’t immediately come in and scan for\n survivors.  It looks like they just left us here to rot.”\n Picard scowled at that thought.  “I don’t think so.  Perhaps that shock wave\n knocked out the rest of the fleet, too.”\n Riker scrambled for the Jeffries tube access in the aft section of the\n bridge.  “Well, by staying here we’re not going to accomplish anything.  We have\n to get to Engineering.”\n “Hold on,” Picard cautioned.  “We need to check on the conditions of the\n rest of the bridge crew.”\n Riker came back to where Picard was standing.  “All right.”  He then\n suddenly looked like he saw a ghost.  “Deanna.

{"id": 626, "text": "Q-Logy\n By Jeff Stoneking\n CHAPTER ONE\n So this was what it was like to be dead?  Consciousness dissipating as the void all around stretches endlessly and no escape is in sight, and an unsettling feeling that there may be no God after all?  Or perhaps there was a God, a single Creator who had deemed that the entity was destined to spend the rest of eternity separated from Him.  Maybe this was a transitional phase in reincarnation, or perhaps the mythical place commonly referred to as purgatory by corporeal life forms.  Being dead for the first time, and seeing that none other of his species had experienced death, the entity didn’t really know what to expect, though various books, religious and secular, had postulated theories throughout the millennia.  For all he knew, the entity would just as well end up in Heaven or Hell, Sto’vo’kor or Gre’thor, or in the Divine Treasury or the Vault of Eternal Destitution, or simply no where at all.  After all, being part of a species that never died, would any of those places welcome him willingly?  He once was a God, so what God would want him to spend eternity with Him?\n “I think,” the entity thought, recalling that was the tell tale sign of being simply a being.  However, the thought took no substance, and seemed to touch nothing in time.  The entity was pulled out of all that was called home, all that was called familiar.  The entity thought, but only unto itself.  “I think yet I think not; I think not and I am dead.”\n With this thought, there was no substance, no root of any kind or reality.  The entity reached out beyond itself into the deep reaches of the cosmos.  If there was an afterlife, the entity was determined to find it.  Unfortunately, nothing answered back.  For the entity’s entire life, there had been a multitudinous array of voices in his head.  The entity had been part of a great societal experiment, never being alone, never being without reach of the arms of comrades or beyond the grasp of their words.  Now the entity was all alone, thinking what might have been the last thought.  Why was the entity being punished so horribly?  Was the execution?  Excommunication?  The entity forgot the details that lead up to this horrific solitude.  There was the vibrancy of life, the wonderment of it all, then nothing.  Emptiness, space, and silence. Would these be the companions of the entity though the rest of eternity?  The entity always wanted to live forever, and kept on telling others that it would live forever, but now the thought of a true eternity terrified the entity.  The entity cried, and it cried out to whoever might listen, but would anybody hear?\n Guinan, off duty and soaking in the beauty of the arboretum, noticed something slightly awry.  She gazed over at Keiko O’Brien, who was fixing her attention on planting seeds she received from Forchin.  Keiko had complained about the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables aboard the Enterprise, stating that replicator technology had a far way to go.  As she was planting yet another seed, her eyes lost their lock on her work and she looked up at Guinan.  There was something awry.\n “Guinan,” Keiko started, “what brings you up here?\n Guinan had entered the arboretum after Keiko and, apparently, Guinan had not noticed Keiko, as her concentration seemed to be broken slightly with Keiko’s question.  “It’s peaceful up here,” Guinan replied with a smile.  “It’s one of those few places one can go on the ship and forget that you are in space.  It’s a nice retreat.”\n “I suppose so,” smiled Keiko.  “You must be reminded all the time you are in space working in Ten-Forward.  Of course, there always is the holodeck.”\n “Oh, I don’t go into the holodeck much unless Jean Luc or somebody else might invite me along for an adventure.  I prefer to relax in more realistic settings,” Guinan replied.\n There was something awry.  Keiko could sense unease in Guinan, as if she was making small talk but there was something charging through her mind at that moment that caused her to be detached from the present.  She felt Guinan had not simply come to the arboretum to be away from the feeling of being on a star ship, but something was preoccupying her, and even though Guinan replied to all of Keiko’s comments, Keiko still felt as if Guinan was not even talking to anybody in particular, really.  Guinan could not even keep in eye contact with Keiko and were in constant gaze out the windows.  Keiko turned her head up and looked out the window.  It was simply a star field, an odd choice for somebody to focus on when they just claimed they wanted to get away from the feeling of being in space.  “What is it?” Keiko asked, hoping to get responses out of Guinan that were perhaps more truthful.\n “I don’t know.  We’re on route to Wadi Besor,” Guinan replied, “but I feel as if we shouldn’t go.  I felt something earlier, a disturbance of some sort.  I can’t describe it entirely, nor even understand it myself.”\n Keiko nodded.  She could not describe in concrete language either, but she sensed something was unusual, as if things were not the same anymore.  “Something is happening but I don’t know what.  From what I’ve seen, everything appears to be status quo.”\n “Yes,” Guinan nodded.  “Status quo.  That’s what they want us to think, anyway.”\n Keiko did not know what to say to that, or how to even how to think she should take it.  At that moment, Miles O’Brien came over Keiko’s com badge, “Keiko, I can’t get off of duty right now to get Molly from the day care.  Do you think you could get her now?”\n “Sure thing, Miles,” Keiko replied, relieved that she had a chance to get away from Guinan.  “Sorry, Guinan, but I have to go,” Keiko said awkwardly as she excused herself.\n Guinan just nodded as if she was unattached from the moment.  As Keiko took her leave of the arboretum, Guinan simply continued to watch out the window as if looking for something, or perhaps expecting something.\n It was not first in the arboretum that Guinan felt this way, however.  It first occurred to her moments after she left Ten Forward, as she walked down the halls of the Enterprise.  Every curve of the corridors, the nuance of each computer console, down to the locations of the Jefferies Tubes caused an odd sensation to course through Guinan’s being.  Yet, all was the same as it has always been.\n “Computer,” Guinan said with hesitation in the arboretum, not sure what to expect, “what ship is this?”\n “This is the USS Enterprise,” the computer spoke back, “registry number NCC-1701-D.”\n That is exactly what Guinan thought she would hear, yet she almost expected to hear something else.  “That,” she said softly and slowly through her lips, “is not right.”  She paused with unease, worry, and confusion forming in her brow and then said, “Computer, locate Captain Picard.”\n “Captain Picard is deceased,” the computer responded as if giving a weather report.  “Date of death: stardate 44741.9.”\n Guinan leaned up against the nearest wall and the words of the computer had barely penetrated her mind and her thoughts.  Something more ominous seemed to emanate from somewhere outside the ship, something she felt and heard all around her, inside her.  It was coming closer, though she could not yet see it.  Out there, beyond the blackness of space, something was coming and it felt terrible.\n “Miles!” Keiko called out down the corridor.  He was walking out of the transporter room, apparently just getting off duty.  Keiko had Molly in her arms as she quickened her pace to meet up with her husband.  “I was just with Guinan in the arboretum.  She is acting awfully strange.”\n Miles chuckled, “As if that’s a surprise?”\n “Seriously, Miles!” Keiko continued.  “I know she can be rather eccentric, but she really has me concerned.  She really seemed to be concerned about our recent mission to Wadi Besor andÉ”\n “Wait a minute?” Miles interrupted.  “How does she know about that?”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[11, 25, "PER"], [278, 285, "PER"], [489, 498, "LOC"], [820, 826, "LOC"], [830, 834, "LOC"], [836, 846, "LOC"], [850, 858, "LOC"], [870, 885, "LOC"], [893, 921, "LOC"], [2653, 2659, "PER"], [2766, 2779, "PER"], [2703, 2712, "LOC"], [2846, 2853, "PER"], [2856, 2861, "PER"], [2934, 2944, "SHIP"], [3099, 3105, "PER"], [3136, 3142, "PER"], [3145, 3150, "PER"], [3187, 3193, "PER"], [3210, 3219, "LOC"], [3226, 3231, "PER"], [3249, 3255, "PER"], [3272, 3277, "PER"], [3334, 3341, "PER"], [3378, 3384, "PER"], [3542, 3547, "PER"], [3613, 3624, "LOC"], [3658, 3666, "LOC"], [3695, 3703, "LOC"], [3716, 3724, "PER"], [3830, 3836, "PER"], [3874, 3879, "PER"], [3902, 3908, "PER"], [4066, 4072, "PER"], [4100, 4109, "LOC"], [4215, 4221, "PER"], [4240, 4247, "PER"], [4258, 4263, "PER"], [4281, 4287, "PER"], [4344, 4350, "PER"], [4391, 4396, "PER"], [4441, 4446, "PER"], [4659, 4664, "PER"], [4703, 4709, "PER"], [4778, 4788, "LOC"], [4791, 4797, "PER"], [4961, 4966, "PER"], [5222, 5228, "PER"], [5297, 5302, "PER"], [5402, 5415, "PER"], [5426, 5433, "PER"], [5446, 5451, "PER"], [5494, 5499, "PER"], [5571, 5576, "PER"], [5579, 5584, "PER"], [5642, 5648, "PER"], [5659, 5665, "PER"], [5686, 5691, "PER"], [5732, 5738, "PER"], [5797, 5802, "PER"], [5825, 5834, "LOC"], [5836, 5842, "PER"], [5970, 5979, "LOC"], [5985, 5991, "PER"], [6065, 6076, "LOC"], [6114, 6124, "SHIP"], [6281, 6289, "PER"], [6356, 6362, "PER"], [6466, 6476, "SHIP"], [6556, 6562, "PER"], [6804, 6818, "PER"], [6823, 6837, "PER"], [6943, 6949, "PER"], [7340, 7345, "PER"], [7348, 7353, "PER"], [7464, 7469, "PER"], [7474, 7479, "PER"], [7565, 7571, "PER"], [7579, 7588, "LOC"], [7624, 7629, "PER"], [7680, 7685, "PER"], [7688, 7693, "PER"], [7839, 7849, "LOC"], [7874, 7879, "PER"]]}
{"id": 627, "text": "“I don’t know,” Keiko replied.  “I didn’t think I should even ask.  What’s the big deal?”\n “Well, our destinations aren’t usually broadcast over the ship,” Miles replied, “and this destination has been kept quiet among the senior crew.”\n “Why?  What’s on Wadi Besor?”\n “It’s the home world of the Taecate,” Miles answered.  “I don’t know exactly why we are going there, but I do know that Captain Tutizi was stationed there on the Federation outpost there, and that he and the Captain were good friends.”\n “Captain Tutizi?” echoed Keiko.  “Wasn’t he murdered?”\n “Exactly,” Miles affirmed, “and as far as I know, his killer is still at large, which is why our trip to Wadi Besor isn’t being made public for the time being, in the event the murderer is on board the ship.  The security team is still investigating the potential that the killer may be on board.”\n “Oh, that’s absurd,” Keiko said.  “The Enterprise was nowhere near Wadi Besor at the time of Tutizi’s death.”\n “They are just keeping the possibility open, Keiko,” Miles said.\n “I don’t care,” insisted Keiko.  “It makes no sense to mark the Enterprise crew as a ship of suspects.  What about all the other ships in Starfleet?”\n “To tell the truth, Keiko, I am not entirely sure of all the ins and outs of this investigation.  What little I do know came from the official channels, which I can assure you.  Nobody is being charged as a suspect yet.  Nevertheless, that’s all beside the point.  I still cannot understand how Guinan knows we are going there.  UnlessÉ”\n “Miles, don’t trail off like that.  You know I hate when you do that.”\n “Well, it’s just that I helped out in stellar spectroscopy earlier today.  Commander Data and I were investigating an anomaly recently located near Wadi Besor.”\n “What kind of anomaly?” Keiko asked.\n “I don’t know,” Miles said.  “But I did see something like it before on one of our missions, I am almost certain of that.”\n “And what are you doing helping Data?  You’re not a science officer,” Keiko wondered.\n “It’s just stellar spectroscopy,” Miles replied.  “It’s pretty elementary stuff, really, and besides, I think it could help me in that promotion I am gunning for at Deep Space Nine.  It never hurts to broaden your horizons, so they say.  As a matter of fact, I am scheduled to go on duty in stellar spectroscopy in an hour.”\n “But you just got off of duty!” Keiko countered.\n “I might have to pull a few double shifts in the next few weeks,” O’Brien mentioned.  “Sorry, but this training for my promotion at Deep Space Nine is killing me too.  I am sure once we get to Deep Space Nine, we will have much more time to ourselves.”\n CHAPTER TWO\n The entity searched through the expanse of nothingness.  Searching for something, perhaps another dead soul wandering though this…this limbo?  The entity did not know what it was.  The blackness stretched seemingly from east to west, with no end in sight.  No throne, no God, no Prophets or wormhole aliens, no vaults or hordes of honored Klingons within any imaginable grasp within this void, not even an angel or a lesser deity made by humanoid hands.  No light, no door, no escape; the entity just drifted through nothing, and with each passing moment grew more weary and more depressed.  Where were the parties?  The fanfare music?  The singing choirs of seraphim?  The hordes of welcoming and willing virgins?  The entity began to question exactly where the eternal resting place would be.\n Unexpectedly, almost frightening the entity, something came up behind it.  The entity refocused his attention and could have smiled if it had a mouth:  It was another disembodied entity, and the entity recognized the second entity.  At last, a friend?\n “Come,” the Captain said, hearing his door chime but not looking up.\n The door slid and a silent presence flowed into the Captain’s ready room that made the Captain uneasy.  He looked up and saw Guinan standing there, as if she were trying to find the words to say.  “Guinan,” he began softly, “what can I do for you?”\n “How did Captain Picard die?” Guinan asked carefully, fearing she was going mad.\n “Guinan,” Captain Riker said with slight hesitation, “Captain Picard was assassinated seven years ago at an archaeological conference.”\n Guinan knew this but she also knew that it was horribly wrong.            In her mind, she was trying to place the pieces of the puzzle together, trying to reconcile what she felt was wrong with what she had known to be reality for all her life. She remembered how Commander Riker received the command of the Enterprise, which took place shortly after Captain Picard’s death.  She could clearly recall each step Riker took the Enterprise along the way:  She remembered how Riker confronted Soran, how Riker found himself in the Nexus and opted to go back far enough in time to save the Enterprise-D from destruction.  These were all things that she could remember as it was reality, but it was reality construed.  However, there was something deep inside her telling her that she had just talked to Captain Picard that morning, though her conscious mind had no recollection of the event.  “What?” she asked, almost as if she was merely arguing with her mind and not even talking to Captain Riker.\n “He was giving the keynote address and an assassin had bypassed security and made his way in with the team that had gathered for the conference.  The alien killed Captain Picard.”\n Guinan steadied herself and looked Riker straight in the eye.  “Captain Riker,” she said, the words sounding unnatural as they came out, “this isn’t right.”  She paused.  “The bridge, the people,” she said as she shook her head and looked around.  She paused a moment and added, “The ship.  What kind of ship is this?  What is its purpose?”\n “The Enterprise is a science vessel,” Riker replied.  “It has been ever since the peace treaty was made with the Vulcans and the Romulans.  Ambassador Spock had brought unification to the two worlds and the Klingons have focused their forces against the Cardassians.”\n “I know that,” Guinan conceded.  “Yet, I know that this is all wrong. This is a ship of exploration, yes, but it also a ship of peace and of defense.  It has greater potential than being a science vessel.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[16, 21, "PER"], [156, 161, "PER"], [255, 265, "LOC"], [297, 304, "SPEC"], [389, 403, "PER"], [431, 441, "GPE"], [477, 484, "PER"], [507, 520, "PER"], [531, 536, "PER"], [573, 578, "PER"], [667, 677, "LOC"], [775, 788, "ORG"], [882, 887, "PER"], [900, 910, "SHIP"], [928, 938, "LOC"], [954, 962, "PER"], [1017, 1022, "PER"], [1025, 1030, "PER"], [1063, 1068, "PER"], [1102, 1112, "SHIP"], [1176, 1185, "ORG"], [1209, 1214, "PER"], [1484, 1490, "PER"], [1529, 1534, "PER"], [1675, 1689, "PER"], [1748, 1758, "LOC"], [1786, 1791, "PER"], [1816, 1821, "PER"], [1956, 1960, "PER"], [1994, 1999, "PER"], [2045, 2050, "PER"], [2176, 2191, "LOC"], [2369, 2374, "PER"], [2453, 2460, "PER"], [2519, 2534, "LOC"], [2580, 2595, "LOC"], [2993, 3001, "SPEC"], [3715, 3722, "PER"], [3825, 3845, "LOC"], [3860, 3867, "PER"], [3898, 3904, "PER"], [3971, 3977, "PER"], [4032, 4046, "PER"], [4053, 4059, "PER"], [4106, 4112, "PER"], [4115, 4128, "PER"], [4159, 4173, "PER"], [4242, 4248, "PER"], [4507, 4522, "PER"], [4551, 4561, "SHIP"], [4594, 4610, "PER"], [4654, 4659, "PER"], [4669, 4679, "SHIP"], [4715, 4720, "PER"], [4732, 4737, "PER"], [4743, 4748, "PER"], [4770, 4775, "LOC"], [4828, 4840, "SHIP"], [5041, 5055, "PER"], [5224, 5237, "PER"], [5403, 5417, "PER"], [5421, 5427, "PER"], [5456, 5461, "PER"], [5485, 5498, "PER"], [5597, 5603, "LOC"], [5768, 5778, "SHIP"], [5801, 5806, "PER"], [5876, 5883, "SPEC"], [5892, 5900, "SPEC"], [5903, 5919, "PER"], [5970, 5978, "SPEC"], [6017, 6028, "SPEC"], [6047, 6053, "PER"]]}
{"id": 628, "text": "“Guinan,” Riker began, “I believe the stress is getting to you.  Perhaps you could talk to Counselor Troi and…”\n “No” Guinan said, as if unattached from the conversation all together.\n “You have gone through a lot in your grieving process since Jean-Luc passed away,” Riker stated.  “I think if you would just talk to her then…”\n “Look,” Guinan said as she backed off, “I’ll get it worked out.  Don’t worry about it.”\n “Guinan, if you should ever want to talk, you can come to Troi or me,” Riker offered.\n Guinan smiled politely and stepped out of the ready room.  “Ten Forward,” she spoke as she entered the turbolift.  Guinan felt inside as if something without was coming towards her, as if something was coming for her…\n “Death has always interested me,” the entity spoke to the approaching entity.  “I thought I was going to be out here alone for an eternity.  Or maybe this is the prelude to some sort of judgment?”\n “You know me?” the other entity spoke.  “How is this possible?  I’ve encountered others but they seemed to be too caught up in personal grief to even notice me.”\n “Ah, good friends are friends forever,” the entity said, “mon capitaine.”\n “Q!” the other entity spoke, recalling at once that he was Jean-Luc Picard.  “What madness is this?  What have you gotten me into now?”\n In a flash, the blackness vanished and Q and Jean-Luc were standing on a hillside, the breeze blowing, the trees waving, the grass beneath them, and the sun shining high in the sky.  It reminded Jean-Luc of his home in France.  “What is this?” Picard demanded, finding that now he had a body, or at least a representation of what was his body.\n “You’re dead,” Q replied, “and your life is about to pass before your eyes, starting with your old stomping grounds.”  He yawned.  “I’m sure it will be as droll as you; wake me when it’s over.”\n “Dead?” Picard echoed.  He remembered being shot, Worf immediately firing upon the assassin, Beverly looking into his eyes during his last moments of life, floating up, seeing his body with Beverly over him along with the other people who had gathered to hear his address, and then he floated out of the ship. He floated out past the stars, into the blackness where he met Q.\n “Deader than a door nail,” Q replied.  “This is my first time dead, too.  You know, I was rather concerned at the start of it all.  I thought I was in human Hell, what with that horrible feeling of isolation and all, but I had no idea why your God would want to send me there, especially since I had done so much work to help His poor, pathetic people.  Then I saw you and I knew that I must be in Heaven.”  Q smiled warmly as he approached Jean-Luc and put his hand on Jean-Luc’s right shoulder.  “Just think, mon capitaine, an eternity together!”\n “You were right the first time,” Picard grumbled as he removed Q’s hand from his shoulder.  “This must be Hell.”\n Q rolled his eyes.  “For once you think you would show a little gratitude!  After all, I was trying to help you out!”\n “You can help me out by returning me to my ship!”\n “I am just as human as you, Picard,” Q replied dryly.  “Don’t you remember?  I came aboard your ship seeking to help you after the Continuum stripped me of my powers but you whined and put me in the brig then the Calamarain came.  They took me, tortured me, and left me for dead on some God forsaken moon.  After that, I was passed from race to race, species to species, being tortured not only for things I had done but also for things the other members of the Continuum had done.  I was actually relieved when the Taecate executed me.”\n “I hope you’re satisfied, Q,” Picard said irately.  “You always wanted to find out all you could about humans and now you get to find out about death.  I hope you’re learning something.”\n “None of this would have happened if you had been more cooperative when I came aboard your ship,” Q advised.\n “What do you mean?” Picard demanded.\n “I came aboard to help you, Picard,” Q stated.  “You know, a funny thing happened to me on my way to eternity-the Continuum showed me what things might have been like had I lived.  One thing that would have been different is that you would still exist in your limited existence in time.”\n “Q, I am not interested in…,” Picard began to say.\n “Oh, but you should be, mon capitaine,” Q replied.  “If I had lived, it would have meant that somebody from your crew was able to save me from the Calamarain and then the Continuum would have restored my powers.  I could have been there to save you from your assassin.”  Picard looked at Q with unbelief.  “Trust me.  That is the way it would have worked out.”\n “I’d rather see you dead and out of our way,” Picard said with a sardonic smile.  “I guess if I had to die as a result then that is a small price to pay.”\n “There you go again, Picard,” Q sighed.  “You do wound me.  I have only wanted to help you; I have always held your best interest in mind.”\n “Thank you for your concern, Q, but we can manage just fine without you,” Picard asserted.  “The last thing humanity needs is your superior attitude directing our lives!”\n “You know,” Q said nostalgically, “that is exactly what John F. Kennedy told me just before he decided to go on his joy ride through Dallas on November 22, 1963.  When he died, I was swimming in the waters of Orxim Theta.  Where were you?”\n “Q…,” Picard began irately.\n “Humanity has never appreciated me,” Q continued.  “I tried to tell Hitler that he could make it as an artist but do you think he listened?  Humph!

{"id": 629, "text": "PART 1\n Stardate 77372.14\n Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of his starship, the USS Lexington. He looked out at the gargantuan Borg vessel on the viewscreen. “Captain, the Borg seem unaware of our presence, but their scans are increasing” said his operations officer, “Maintain Grey-mode Protocol” he ordered. The ship was following the Borg Cube trying to divert it from its course to Earth. Starfleet was bogged down with the Borg in other sectors and even with help from the Klingons and Romulans, they were not making much headway. Planet after planet in system after system were falling to the Borg. a siren alerted at the tactical status, “Captain, we’ve been detected, Borg vessel altering course to an attack position” reported his tactical officer, “Full shields and weapons, fire” he ordered. The Borg vessel was faster as his crew bustled. The first shot was staggering. Explosions rocked the vessel, throwing the Captain to the floor. “Damage report” demanded the Captain, staggering to his feet, “Hull breach on deck 24, main power to 15%, secondary power and emergency back-ups are destroyed, weapons are offline, shields are at 27%, Sir” shouted his tactical officer, “Number 1” he shouted, mimicking an old mentor and role model. His first officer was dead under some debris. The ops officer shouted up, “Captain, what’s left of the sensors are detecting tachyon emissions “. The Captain ignored that and shouted, “Helm, all forward, lay in a collision course, Lieutenant, drop an emergency beacon with information about what happened here” he ordered to his bridge staff, “Bridge to Main Engineering, shunt all available power to the impulse engines on my mark” he said. He took a deep breath to calm himself, “Mark” he said, “Power shunted, Captain” said the Chief Engineer. “Helm, Engage” he said. The ship moved forward, disintegrating as it went, the computers warning system kicked in, “Warning, collision detected, impact in 30 seconds”. The Captain watched with resignation as the Borg ship completely filled the viewscreen. Just before impact he saw a bright light, then lost consciousness.\n Stardate 48905.72. USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Earth\n Captain Jean-Luc Picard sat face to face with Admiral Edward Robertson. Sat next to him was Commander William Riker. The Admiral was briefing the Enterprise command officers as to their mission, “Captain, you understand this mission is to be classified, news of the possible return of the Borg could destabilise the Quadrant. Given that previous Borg attacks have been targeted at humanity, it might give those hostile to Starfleet the excuse they have been looking for to launch assaults along the Federation Borders” said the Admiral, “Understood, Sir, shall we be on our way, time is critical if it is indeed the Borg” said Picard. The wizened Admiral nodded, “Very well, Captain, I pray that I’m wrong” said the Admiral. The Admiral stood, shaking hands with Picard and Riker before leaving the briefing room. Before Picard or Riker could say anything, Lieutenant Commander Data contacted them, “Data to Picard, Captain, internal sensors are reading massive tachyon and chronoton emissions on deck 4” he said. Picard and Riker looked at each other, “Are you sure, Mr Data” said Picard, “Quite certain, Captain, the emissions seem to be occurring in an area about the size of a humanoid male about 6 feet tall” said Data. “Very well, Mr Data, have a security detail meet me and Commander Riker on deck 4” said Picard, leaving the briefing room with Commander Riker close behind.\n 5 minutes later, Picard, Riker and the security forces sent by Data and Worf were at the area where the tachyons were concentrated. The corridor seemed normal. Nothing seemed out of place, “Picard to Data, we have arrived at the area you directed us to, but there doesn’t seem to be anything here” he said. There was slight interference when Data responded, “Captain, the emissions are concentrating into one area, you might see something in the next few minutes” said Data, through the interference. They did.\n As the emissions condensed and concentrated, a bright light filled the corridor. When it cleared enough for the crew to look, a man lay on the deck. His uniform wasn’t recognisable, but the insignia showed he was a Starfleet officer. “Medical scan” ordered Picard. He watched the medic scanning the new man, and looked at him with a comparative eye. Whereas his uniform was black all the way up to the shoulder with red on the shoulders and a blue collar showing with his four command pips, the strangers uniform was black up to the shoulder where the shoulder pads turned grey. The collar was red and Captain Picard noticed that he was looking at another Starfleet Captain. “He’s alive, Captain” said a Security Ensign, “Picard to Transporter Room Three, two to beam directly to sickbay” said the Captain. They both dissolved and left the Commander and the security team on the deck. “Picard to Riker, return to the bridge and set a course for Ceridian III, Warp 6” said the Captain as Doctor Beverley Crusher examined her patient. The Captain watched the bustle quietly as they worked to heal the man’s extensive injuries. Thirty minutes later, the medical team stepped away from the patient, “I’ve stabilized him for the moment, but he is very weak. The next hour should determine his rate of recovery” she said. The Captain pondered the situation, “Can you wake him” he asked. The Doctor looked at him again, “Yes, of course, but he will be very weak” she replied.\n Captain Mark Smith was slowly becoming aware of his surroundings. It took him a few seconds to realize that he shouldn’t be able to become aware of his surroundings at all. He tentatively opened his eyes and saw a face that he hadn’t seen in the 20 years since his death. Captain Jean-Luc Picard stood over him. This was impossible as the Captain had been dead for 20 years. “My name is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise” he said briskly, “I know who you are, Sir” said Smith weakly, “I’m Captain Mark Smith, USS Lexington” he said. Before the Captain could reply, Smith fed him the vital piece of information, “Captain, I grew up on this ship, I think I have travelled back in time” he said. Picard didn’t seem surprised, “Yes, we observed tachyon emissions around the time and place you were discovered. But who are you to have grown up aboard the Enterprise” said Picard. Smith sighed, “My dad was the Deputy Chief Engineer who was killed in an EPS explosion when I was eleven” said Smith, “Yes, Lieutenant Smith was killed a week ago, Mr LaForge is trying to find out exactly what caused the explosion. Counsellor Troi is working with, erm, you” said Picard. There was a moment of awkward silence between the Captains. “What’s the Stardate where you’re from” said Picard. Smith cleared his throat, “77371.95” he said. The Captain sighed, “What’s Starfleet doing 40 years from now” said Picard, genuinely interested, “Well, Sir, there is lots I can’t say because of the Temporal Prime Directive. I couldn’t tell you much about the next forty years. However, for the last two years in my time, the Federation has been plagued by the Borg. The USS Alaska monitored several temporal distortions around the badlands, and a number of them had Borg signatures. When the Borg started hitting Federation colonies, the temporal schisms became a low priority” said Smith. Picard looked at him, looking ever so slightly haunted at the mention of the Borg, “What were you doing when you ended up on the Enterprise” asked Picard. Smith wracked his brain, “I believe that we were following a Borg vessel when we were detected. My ship was heavily damaged so I ordered all power to be diverted to the impulse engines and lay in a collision course” said Smith. Picard responded instantly, “Captain, we are on a mission to investigate the sudden appearance of Borg vessels in the Ceridian System. There have been no Borg incursions since the Battle of Wolf 359, but a deep space sensor relay suddenly picked up about 20 signatures. The Enterprise has been sent to investigate” said Picard. Smith frowned, “What’s the precise Stardate, Sir” said Smith, “48905.72” replied Picard. Smith suddenly had all his fears confirmed, “Captain, my recollection of this Stardate is the Enterprise going to Starbase 384 for weapons system refits” said Smith. Picard looked at him, “Yes, but Admiral Robertson redirected us to investigate the readings from the deep space sensor array” said Picard, equally concerned. “It would appear that some event has changed the timelines, quite possibly starting with the Borg invasion in my time, leading to the destruction of my ship to my appearance aboard the Enterprise” said Smith.\n On the bridge Commander Riker was looking at the sensors with Data. “What could be causing these readings, Mr Data” said Riker. Data made a face that almost looked pensive, “The parameters do not conform to that of any known sub-space or temporal distortions currently on record, Sir” said Data. Riker considered his options, “Any theories” he said. Before data responded, Worf spoke up, “Commander, there is a Borg signature emanating from the distortion. A Gravimetric distortion extending from the main disturbance” he said. Before the commander could give an order, the ship was enveloped in the gravimetric disturbance. “Red alert, Captain Picard to the bridge” said Riker, “All engines, full reverse” he ordered. The ship shuddered violently as the helm officer carried out Riker’s orders, “Commander, engines are at full reverse, it’s not having any effect” said the helm officer.\n Down in sickbay, Captain Picard was deliberating with Captain Smith, “Captain, come with me” said Picard. The Captains left the sickbay and walked towards the bridge. “Picard to the Bridge, Number One, what’s the situation” said Picard. “We are caught in a gravimetric distortion expanding from a larger anomaly. Mr Worf has detected a Borg signature and Mr Data has no theories. Engines are at full reverse but it’s not having any effect” said Riker. Picard sighed, “Understood” he said.\n Riker was watching the situation evolve in front of him. “Bridge to LaForge, I need more power to the impulse drive” said Riker urgently as the ship shook more violently, “I’ll do what I can, Sir, but if we keep this up the manifolds will rupture and we’ll be dead in the water” said Commander LaForge. The turbolift doors hissed open and Captain Picard stepped out with the other Captain, Riker was aware of the ripple of unease at the stranger on the bridge. “Report, Commander” said Picard, “Sir our best indication is that a Borg vessel is about to emerge from the distortion, there are chronoton emissions emanating from the distortion” said Riker, he looked at the other Captain, “It’s possible that this distortion could also lead to your time, Sir” said Riker. Picard looked to Smith, “Suggestions” he said. Smith thought for a second. “Mr Data, can you display sensor readings or the distortion on the main viewer” said Smith. Data complied instantly and Smith studied the readings, “This looks like a Borg Transwarp conduit, but the readings are unusual. Commander Riker’s assessment is correct, Sir, this distortion could indeed lead to my time” said Smith. He walked over to Worf, “Commander, launch a photon torpedo at these coordinates , prime it to explode on arrival. The antimatter discharge may break the ship free, helm reduce power before the manifolds rupture” he said, walking back to Picard and Riker at the centre of the bridge. He looked at Picard, “Ready, Sir, that should free the Enterprise from the distortion field” he said. Picard nodded, “Mr Worf, fire torpedoes” said Picard. Worf nodded, “Firing, Captain”. The torpedo flew from the ship, exploding right on target, “Captain, gravimetric distortion is weakening” reported Data, “Helm full reverse” said Picard.\n As the Enterprise  reversed away from the distortion, a Borg vessel protruded from it. The vessel was enormous in size and scope. “Captain, engines are overtaxed from the effort of escaping the distortion, we must power down or the impulse manifolds will rupture” said the helm officer. Picard focused on the helm officer, “Warp Engines” he questioned. The helm officer checked, “No, Captain, the gravimetric disturbances are interfering with the warp bubble I can’t get it to stabilize” said the helm officer. Smith stepped in, “Ensign, is there a way to reduce the warp profile of the Enterprise” said Smith. The Ensign thought for a second, “Yes but we can’t do it from here” she said, “ there is a malfunction in the command relays, it will have to be done from Main Engineering” she said. Picard stood, tapping his communicator, “Picard to Engineering, Mr LaForge, find a way to lower the warp profile of the ship” he said. The Borg ship continued to emerge from the distortion when LaForge contacted them again, “LaForge to Bridge, warp profile should be concealed” said LaForge. The Borg vessel was fully out of the distortion and the distortion was dissipating. “Scan the vessel, Mr Data” said Picard. Data scanned the Borg ship. “It is larger than the Borg vessels we have encountered so far, but its structure is perfectly geometric. There is a large section of damage to the vessel, indicating that a starship similar in size to the Enterprise collided with the ship” said Data. A sound of anguish and pain came from Captain Smith. The crew looked at him, “Remember what I said, Captain. The last thing I remember before waking up on deck 4 was my ship being heavily damaged in a Borg attack as a Borg vessel headed for Earth. I rammed the Borg to try and destroy them. I failed” said Captain Smith, sinking to his knees. A beeping cut through the tension on the bridge, “Captain, we are being hailed” said Worf. Captain Smith still knelt on the bridge, head held in shame, Captain Picard stood and walked forwards. Before he could order the channel open Worf said, “We are being scanned, Sir”. Picard looked at the damaged vessel, “Open a channel” he said. The screen showed an image of a terrible creature. It looked like a woman, only it had tubes sticking out of the crown of its head. Captain Picard and Captain Smith recognised it as a Borg queen. Her face showed an expression that had she not been an emotionless cybernetic abomination would have been likened to imperious and smug. “Locutus” she said to Picard. Picard’s face stonewalled, “That is not my name” he said, “Why do you resist us, Locutus, you know what we are capable of” she said. The bridge was quiet as Captain Picard and the Borg queen faced off. “Lucky for you, Locutus, we are not interested in you today” said the Borg queen suddenly. “Then what do you want” demanded Picard, coldly. She almost smiled, “Captain Mark Smith” she said, the words carefully measured for maximum effect. Picard’s gaze swung toward Smith briefly, “And if we refuse” said Picard. The Borg queen didn’t answer straight away. After a couple of seconds she said, “Deck 14 is now overrun with drones. If you do not had us Mark Smith, they will force visual and audio imagery of the slow assimilation of your crew until you change your mind” she said. Before Picard could respond, Smith stood, rage filling his thoughts. “You want me? Fine. Prepare to receive me, but if you want an easy assimilation subject, no if you expect an easy assimilation target then prepare for the biggest resistance you have ever encountered” said Smith. Picard flashed him a steely glare. “You’re threats are irrelevant, you know I won’t sacrifice a member of my crew” said Picard. Smith shot Picard an equally steely glare, “With respect, Captain Picard, the lives of the crew aboard this ship are worth more than mine. I lost my ship and all my crew are dead, so I will do anything to protect this ship and this crew” said Smith. Before Picard could respond the Borg queen smiled, that same mechanic, mirthless smile. “Not all of your crew are dead, Captain” she said.\n To be continued…", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null,

{"id": 630, "text": "PART 2\n Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Captain Mark Smith stood at a critical turning point. The Borg had placed a demand for Captain Smith. Captain Picard knew that handing him over would only mean that the Borg would chase the Enterprise until they recaptured him. Picard also had a hostage situation on deck 14 where the malicious Borg queen had transported scores of drones aboard as leverage to get what they wanted. Picard was trying to maintain control of a hot-headed Captain Smith who wanted to rescue the remnants of his crew. “If you have my crew, show me” demanded Smith. The Borg queen didn’t respond, other than moving aside to show two drones holding a struggling figure of a woman in the same uniform as him. “Mark” came the struggled gasps of the woman. Again Captain Smith fell to his knees as he recognised Lieutenant Commander Alyssa Smith, his wife”. The Borg queen again stepped back into the picture, “Will you join us, Smith” asked the queen, knowing she had the Enterprise crew and Smith backed into a corner. Knowing the situation was beyond him, Smith looked to Picard, “Captain” he said, resigned and defeated. Picard looked to him, “I cannot allow you to leave this ship, the Borg will just come after us again regardless, but then again, I cannot expect you to abandon your crew” said Picard, “Sir, we can’t save them” said Smith, “The Enterprise is more important” he said. Riker exploded, “How can you abandon them to assimilation”. Smith glared at him, “I don’t do it easily, Commander, that’s my wife on the screen, but here and now I have a duty as a Starfleet officer” he said. He turned to the screen, “My love, I’m sorry” he said, head sinking, before turning his attention to the Borg queen, “Go to hell, you skinny mechanic bitch” he growled. The drone holding Lieutenant Commander Smith lifted its hand, injecting the nanites into her blood stream. She screamed, the pain unbearable as the Borg nanites began to alter her. Her scream was not long-lived. Soon only a shell of the former human remained. “Locutus, you will be ours again, Smith, you will make an excellent drone” said the queen, closing the channel. A sniffle escaped Smith.\n Worf was intently watching the sensors throughout the whole exchange, nothing had really changed until now, “Captain, Borg weapons systems charging” he said. Picard wasted no time, “Helm, Warp 4, engage” he shouted. The Enterprise leapt away to warp 4. “Captain, receiving a distress transmission from deck 14” said Worf. Picard stood up, “Are the Borg following us from Earth” he asked. Worf checked the sensors, “Yes, Captain, closing at warp 7” said Worf. “Increase to maximum warp” he said, “Lets lead them away from Earth, Mr Worf, scan deck 14, I want to know what’s going on down there” said Picard. Worf worked the sensors, “Captain, visual contact” said Worf. “On screen” said Picard. The corridor was dark, drones moved around assimilating crewmembers of the Enterprise. Picard and the Bridge crew watched in horror, “Survivors” asked Riker. “None, Commander, all either assimilated or in the process of being assimilated” said Worf. The bridge was silent, “Vent deck 14” ordered Picard. The crew rippled, “Captain” said Commander Riker, “Number one, venting deck 14 might spare the crew a living hell, I’m doing it to save the Enterprise” said Picard. Worf keyed in the command sequence, “Ready, Captain” he said, indicating that the deck was primed for venting. “Make it so, Commander” said Picard. Worf punched it in. “Venting complete, Captain” said Riker, “Nothing is alive down there” he finished.\n The Borg cube pursued the Enterprise relentlessly. The Borg queen was hell bent, if you could consider her hell bent, on capturing Locutus and Captain Smith. The Enterprise was going at maximum cruise speed. She watched as the Enterprise drew closer as the Borg ship was outrunning her. She could picture the resistance that Locutus and Smith would put up as they were assimilated into the Collective. If you could call what she felt pleasure, she had a pleasurable anticipation of the assimilation to come.\n Back on the Enterprise, Captain Picard watched the Borg ship closing in, “What is our current velocity” he asked. “Warp 9.2, Sir” reported Data, “Increase to Warp 9.8” said Picard. Smith stood up, “Captain, Warp 9.8 puts the Enterprise at extreme risk, especially given that the Borg are pursuing us” said Captain Smith. Picard looked over at him, “What are you suggesting, Mr Smith” he asked. “Mr Data, show me a map of the region” said Captain Smith. The map came up at Data’s station. “There, the Archanis Nebula, if we head there at Warp 9.6, we can be there in about 11 hours. With that Borg cube as badly damaged as it is, it is unlikely that they will be able to go much faster that Warp 9.6” said Smith. Picard nodded, “Make it so” he said, returning to the command chair.\n The Borg queen experienced something that could be likened to rage and frustration. The Enterprise had increased speed to Warp 9.6 and with the damage caused by the impact with the Lexington meant that the cube could not outpace the Enterprise. The only way they would out run the ship is if they carried on for more than 12 hours and had to drop out of warp. The entire collective consciousness of the Borg was focused on the Enterprise and little more.\n 10 hours 53 minutes 23 seconds later\n The Enterprise dropped out of warp and headed into the nebula. Commander Riker stood next to Data’s station, “Captain, this nebula has a high level of Particle Flux, we can’t stay in here long” he said. Picard nodded, “How long do we have, Number one” he said, gravely. Riker looked at the screen, “24 minutes, Captain”. “Take us to the edge of the nebula, Mr Worf, prepare a full spread of Photon torpedoes to fire straight into the damaged section of the Borg cube” said Captain Picard. “Aye, Sir” said Worf. The Enterprise moved out at half impulse, Worf ready to unleash the Enterprise’s weapons systems on the Borg ship. When they reached the edge of the Nebula, there was no Borg ship. “Full sensor scan” said Picard. Data performed the Scan, “Captain Smith, please have a look at this information” said Data. Smith had a look, “Captain, the Borg vessel has set a course for Starbase 245, it looks like it’s just approaching the edge of sensor range, so presume it’s moving at Warp 9.7” said Captain Smith. Picard looked shocked, “Bridge to Engineering, Geordi, what is the effect on the warp engines from our prolonged travel at warp 9.6” he said, “We have to keep power output of the warp engines to a minimum, Captain, I suggest you don’t push her faster than warp 7”  said Geordi LaForge. Picard turned to Data, “Mr Data, how soon could we be there at warp 7” he said, “2 hours 28 minutes 45 seconds, Sir” said Data, “Helm, lay in a pursuit course, Engage” said Picard.\n Starbase 245\n Commodore Andre Heston was the base commander of Starbase 245. It was a quiet assignment as Starfleet had always routed invading forces before they approached the base. Today however, they were watching the sensors as they showed a Borg vessel approaching at high warp with no Federation Starships to route it. The Commodore watched as the crew bustled to the final preparations, making sure the weapons and shields were active. “Sir, Borg vessel arrival in 2 minutes” said an officer. This was it, the battle was afoot and there was nothing anyone could do about it. Moments later, the gargantuan cube dropped out of warp. Without warning it savagely attacked the Starbase. Within moments officers were reporting shield failures and hull breaches. After a meagre 7 minutes, the station was little more than a debris field. The Borg cube silently moved off, hoping to lure the Enterprise towards them.\n 2 hours 21 minutes later\n The USS Enterprise dropped out of warp 50000 kilometres away from the debris field that was Starbase 245. “My God” said Captain Smith looking at the devastation left in the wake of the Borg. “Captain, the Borg are trying to lure us into a trap. Judging by the continuing trail away from this site, it is the only conceivable solution”. Riker thought hard, “We need reinforcements, Captain, but we can’t take the Enterprise back into Federation space. The Borg would just follow” he said. “Mr Worf, what is the nearest Starship to our location” he said. Worf checked, “The Galaxy, Sir” he responded. “Open a channel” he ordered. Within seconds, the face of Captain Alex Bertrum was on the screen, “Captain Picard, how can we help you” he said, “We need to get an officer back to Earth to brief the Council about a Borg invasion. But I can’t take the Enterprise back in to Federation Space, could you rendezvous with us” asked Picard, “Certainly, Captain, set a course to meet us and we will do the same, rendezvous in 3 hours, Galaxy out”  said Captain Bertrum. “Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at warp 6” said Picard, “All senior officers, report to the bridge” said Riker.\n Picard, Riker, Data and Worf walked into the observation lounge. Picard took the seat at the head of the table and waited, the tension palpable between the officers. Moments later, Doctor “Commander” Beverley Crusher, Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge and Councillor “Lieutenant Commander” Deanna Troi walked into the briefing room. When they were all seated. “For those who haven’t met our new crewmate, this is Captain Mark Smith. He commands the Federation Starship Lexington about 30 years from now and was only sent back when he intersected with a temporal distortion” said Picard, introducing Smith. There was a ripple of recognition as they all recognised the 41 year old version of the boy who still regularly saw Councillor Troi and Doctor Crusher. “Good Morning” said Smith, formally to the people who had helped raise him to what he was. “As you know the Borg are trying to lure this ship into a trap in an attempt to acquire Captain Smith and myself, so we can’t fly back to Earth, without bringing the Borg down on us. So we are setting a course to rendezvous with the USS Galaxy. I will go aboard the Galaxy and we will head back to Earth at maximum warp. Commander Riker and Captain Smith will assume control of the ship, with Captain Smith leading the Borg away” said Picard. Picard turned to Smith, inviting him to talk, “I know it won’t be easy, taking orders from someone you perceive to be a small boy, but I promise you, I will do everything I can to keep this ship safe. I would welcome any suggestions you might have while I’m in Command” said Smith. Picard turned back to the crew, “We rendezvous with the Galaxy in 3 hours, Captain Smith please stay, the rest of you return to your duties” he said. Captain Smith remained seated alongside Captain Picard. “Captain, what I’m about to do is dangerous. When I was assimilated by the Borg, they assimilated my thought patterns and its possible that wherever they are they know what I’m planning, or at least they can guess” he said. He looked distant for a moment, and Smith knew what pressure this was putting on the Captain. “I’m going to send a report to the Admiralty explaining who you are, but I’m going to classify it top secret, so you will have to get into a Starfleet uniform like what the crew wears. I also would like you to keep a sensor lock on the USS Galaxy for as long as you can in case the Borg attack. Are you prepared to command my ship, Captain” said Picard, “Aye, Sir” said Smith, “Computer, transfer all command functions to Captain Smith, authorization Picard Alpha Tango” said Picard. “There is no Authorization for Captain Smith, please enter the relevant information” said the computer. “Computer, enter authorization code Smith Zulu five” said Smith, “Register information under Captain Mark Smith” said Smith. “Command functions transferred to Captain Mark Smith” said the cool voice of the computer. “The Enterprise is now your ship, Captain” said Picard. Smith smiled sadly, “The Enterprise will always be your ship, Captain, I will just be another chapter in hers and your story, Sir” said Captain Smith.\n 3 hours later\n The USS Galaxy was holding position just off the starboard bow awaiting Captain Picard’s arrival. “Smith to Transporter room two, is Captain Picard ready to disembark” he said, “Yes, Sir, just waiting for confirmation from the Galaxy, Sir” replied Miles O’Brien. Smith settled into his chair and his new uniform. “As soon as you have confirmation from the Galaxy, beam Captain Picard over” he said, “Yes, Sir” said O’Brien.\n Captain Smith was somewhat uncomfortable. The universe was in a state of temporal flux that none could predict and he and Captain Picard were now right at the centre of things. A single mistake could result in the destruction of the Enterprise, writing the rest of history for the Federation in a completely different manner, it could even destroy the Federation. As the report came in that Captain Picard had been transported to the other ship, Smith ordered that a wide band covariant signal be transmitted on all frequencies and that the ship move away at warp 6. As far as all intelligence aboard the Enterprise, only one Borg vessel had been reported, so that meant they had to keep it busy until Picard could muster the fleet to destroy it.  “Captain, Borg vessel approaching from heading 232 mark 4” said Worf, his deep voice rumbling across the bridge, “Hold your course, Mr Evans” ordered Smith as the crew rippled with unease. “Mr Worf, Report” he said  turning to look at his tactical officer. Worf checked the sensors, “Borg vessel is approaching at warp 9.1 , visual contact in ten seconds, its weapons are fully charged” said Worf. Smith sighed, “On Screen” he said. The image showed a Borg vessel, but it looked to be too small to be a Borg cube. “Magnify” he said. The magnified image showed a Borg sphere, “Damn” shouted Smith, “Mr Evans, drop out of warp, Mr Data, contact the Galaxy, warn them that they might be at risk of attack” said Smith. “Time to intercept, 1 minute, 24 seconds”  said Worf. “Red Alert, all hands to battle stations” said Riker. “Captain, I am unable to raise communications with the Galaxy” said Data. “Sensors show a second Borg signal on an intercept course with the Galaxy” said Worf, as the Borg sphere dropped out of warp. “Mr Worf, fire a full spread of photons and phasers at a concentrated section of that vessel” he said, “Helm, lay in an intercept course for the USS Galaxy, maximum warp” he said. He watched dispassionately as Worf’s barrage of weapon fire slammed into the Borg vessel, ripping it apart. “Helm, the USS Galaxy, engage” he said, urgency gripping him.\n The Enterprise jumped to warp. “ETA on the Galaxy” he said, “12 minutes, Captain” said the helm officer, “Maintain course and speed” he said, “Senior officers, report to the bridge” said Smith. He turned to Commander Riker, “Mr Riker, when we complete this briefing, I want  you and Mr Worf to prepare a fully armed security detail and lead it over to the Galaxy if I see fit” said Smith. “Aye, Sir are you expecting trouble” said Riker, “Yes, Commander” he turned to Councillor Troi, “Councillor, what do you imagine the news of an imminent threat to the Federation would do to the crew” he said, “ Panic them, and if we are wrong, it would cause resent and the crew would be bristling under your command” said Troi. Smith sighed, “Options, we are facing a real and present danger from the Borg and I cannot in good consciousness keep them in the dark” he said. Smith wished he had Picard’s wisdom in this situation, “We are informing the crew, I’ll address them at the proper moment” he said as the bridge turbolift doors hissed open and the senior officers stepped out. “This is a critical briefing, it will be given to all hands, open internal communications link” he said. He sighed, “All hands this is the bridge, there is an extreme risk to the Federation. We just lost contact with the USS Galaxy which Captain Picard transferred to in order to warn Earth of the impending Borg attack. We have reason to believe that the Galaxy is under attack from a Borg cube and are therefore setting a course to intercept, I want all stations battle ready in 4 minutes” he said, closing the internal comms. “I need to options. The Enterprise may be out matched by the Borg and I need ways to keep her in the fight. Mr LaForge, Mr Data, work on a way of increasing shields and weapons to compensate for the adaptive nature of the Borg, Commander Riker, Mr Worf, I need tactical strategies in place. Captain Picard may still be in a position where we can rescue him and so we must try to do so. The future of the Federation may depend on it” he said, “Doctor Crusher, Captain Picard may be injured if we can retrieve him, and the battle may cause injuries across the ship, I want your medical teams on full standby” he said as Doctor Crusher nodded her assent. “Councillor Troi, I need you to remain on the bridge, with the rest of the senior staff off the bridge, I’ll need you to act as my first officer” he said, Troi looked worried, but accepted his orders, “Captain, we are approaching the USS Galaxy I’m not reading any Borg vessels” said the Helmsman, “Slow to 1/3” he said. “Mr Worf, open a channel, we shouldn’t have met the Galaxy so soon” he said. Turning his attention to the Galaxy, he said “Enterprise to Galaxy”. There was no response, “Enterprise to Galaxy, please respond” still nothing, “Mr Worf, intensive scan” he said. Worf scanned the Galaxy, “Nothing out of the ordinary, Captain”. Then the first shot came. “Captain, we are being hailed” said Worf, “On screen” shouted Captain Smith.\n The Borg queen observed the crew of the USS Enterprise with an almost excited disposition. She knew that they would be demoralized when they saw her, and even more demoralized to see who accompanied her and what she had done to him.  It pleased her to have so many new ‘children’ in her fold. “You, what the hell are you playing at” said Captain Smith. “Perfecting the galaxy” replied the queen cryptically. “Where is Captain Picard” demanded Smith.\n The bridge crew of the Enterprise were bristling at the appearance of the Borg queen on the USS Galaxy. The Borg queen hadn’t responded to Captain Smith’s question as to the whereabouts of Captain Picard. Suddenly she stepped aside. A figure stepped forward, “I am Locutus of Borg, lower your shields and surrender your ship, resistance is futile”\n To be continued…", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[8, 31,

{"id": 631, "text": "PART 3\n Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of the USS Enterprise looking at her former Captain. “Resistance is futile, lower your shields and surrender your ship. Your culture will adapt to service us” said Locutus, formerly Captain Picard, “No, we will not surrender, Locutus, you were taken from the Borg by this crew and restored to Captain Picard before” said Captain Smith. “The unit Picard is part of us, he cannot be removed” said Locutus, “Surrender is the only option” he said. Smith sighed, “Commander, prepare boarding parties to recover Captain Picard” he said, “Mr Worf, go with him” he said. Ensign Macaulay stepped up to replace Worf, “Ensign, target the Galaxy shields, Mr Data, do whatever you have to, to keep the Enterprise a step ahead of the Borg” he said. Weapons fire from the Galaxy hit the Enterprise first. The power of the shots quickly overwhelmed the defences, “Damage report” shouted Captain Smith. “Main power is offline” shouted Ensign Macaulay, “Shields and Weapons are inoperative, hull integrity down to 74%” shouted Data. “Helm, reverse course, full impulse” shouted Smith, “Manifolds can’t handle full impulse, Captain” shouted the helm officer. “Commander LaForge” shouted Smith, “I’ll be in Engineering” replied LaForge.\n Commander Riker was regaining his feet, “Riker to Bridge, what’s happening” said Riker, tapping his commbadge, “The Galaxy is attacking, we are taking heavy damage. I’m sorry, Commander, we have to pull back and focus on rescuing Captain Picard another time” said Smith, “Understood, Captain” said Riker. He steadied himself against another shot, “Mr Worf, what are the odds that the Borg try to board the ship” asked Riker, “High, Sir, the Borg only live to assimilate, it is their way” he said, “Take a security detachment and secure main engineering. I’ll take the rest and secure other key areas of the ship” said Riker, “Aye, Commander replied Worf. The officers walked in separate directions leading security detachments across the ship. As they went another volley of shots crippled secondary power, “Right, we won’t make it to the bridge, I suggest we head to sickbay and help Doctor Crusher keep the wounded alive and safe” said Riker.\n The bridge lights exploded, “Captain, impulse engines are offline” shouted Data, “I’ve lost helm control” shouted the Helm officer, “Secondary power systems are offline” shouted the stand-in tactical officer. The assault stopped, “Captain, incoming message from the Galaxy, audio only” reported Ensign Macaulay. “Let’s have it” demanded Captain Smith. “Witness the beginning, resistance is futile” said the voice of Locutus.\n Stardate 48922.81, Starfleet Headquarters, San Francisco\n Vice Admiral John Adamson was looking at the report given to him by Captain Michael Thornton, Commanding Officer of the USS Akira. “Captain, I want an account of everything” said the Admiral, “Sir, about 4 hours ago, we lost contact with the Starships Enterprise and Galaxy. Our sensors picked up massive amounts of weapons fire as well as Borg signatures. When everything died down, we detected a starship but we could not open a line of communication. Intensive scans showed it to be the Enterprise, she was maintaining position when we moved back to transmission range. Admiral, we are the only other starship within 4 days of the Enterprise, if the Borg are gathering forces in this area, we need more ships” said Captain Thornton. “Understood, Captain, you are to hold your position on the edge of the sector until reinforcements arrive. Monitor the Neutral Zone for any signs of the Romulans taking advantage of the weakened state of the Enterprise, Adamson Out” he said. He turned away from the viewscreen feeling uneasy. As the head of Fleet operations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard had filed a report about Captain Smith, and the position Picard was assigning him. With the Galaxy and Picard MIA and a heavy Borg presence being noted, along with the destruction of Starbase 245, the Admiral was becoming concerned with the security of the Federation.\n “Damn it, we were attacked 4 hours ago, Locutus could be anywhere by now and we have no way of contacting Starfleet” snapped Captain Smith, in what was left of Starboard observation. “Mr LaForge, status of the Engines” he said, “We think we have thrusters back, Captain, we need to test them before we can bring Impulse and Warp power back online” he said. He nodded, his temper subsiding slightly. “Mr Data, how are the sensors” he said, “We can only use short range sensors at the present time. All long range sensors have been destroyed” he said. Smith’s head dropped, “Find a way to reroute long range sensors through the short range sensor arrays, then transfer all power from the long range arrays back into shields and weapons. Mr LaForge, assist Mr Data when we are sure about the status of the Engines” he said. Riker pitched in, “Captain, Doctor Crusher is requesting that anyone with a level 2 medical qualification assist her teams in triage” he said. “Give her all the help she needs” ordered Smith. He turned his attention to Worf, “What about weapons” he said, “The phasers are being repaired as we speak. The torpedo firing system is online” he said. Smith sighed, “Very well, dismissed, prepare for engine trials” he said, joining the officers as they stepped onto the bridge. “Helm, forward thrusters to 50%, port and starboard at station keeping” he said. The thrusters activated, seemingly without fault, “LaForge to Bridge, Captain, the thrusters repairs are complete, I can give you partial impulse in 10 minutes and partial warp in 15 minutes”  said LaForge. Exhausted with the fatigue of defeat, Captain Smith turned to Councillor Troi, the most senior officer on the bridge at that time, “Councillor, you have the bridge, alert me if we run across the Galaxy” he said, walking into his ready room as Councillor Troi sat in the command chair.\n After a few hours of restlessness, he was thrown to the floor as an explosion rocked the ship. “Report” he said. Walking out onto the bridge, “Romulans” was the only reply, “Open a channel” ordered Smith. The stand in tactical officer was doing so, “No response, Captain”. Smith pondered, in his time, the Romulans were allies, he even had Romulan friends, but where he was now, they would attack and they would not consider being friends. They wanted a ship like the Enterprise.  “Back us off, use thrusters and impulse engines to get us inside that proto-stellar nebula” ordered Smith. “Captain, if we go in there, we will be cornered, if the Romulans leave, the Borg will just take their place” said Ensign Macaulay. “Agreed, very well, Ensign, helm go to warp 1 and get us away from Romulan space” ordered the Captain.\n The Enterprise repairs were going well, after 15 hours, weapons and shields were at 94% while Data and LaForge had managed to enhance the short range sensor arrays with long range equipment. Impulse engines had been fully repaired and Commander LaForge was preparing to unlock the magnetic constrictors and allow the full use of the warp drive. Commander Riker had returned to the bridge, but he had left security details at main engineering and sickbay ready for any Borg incursions. They were both sat in their chairs at the centre of the bridge. “Captain, our long range sensors have picked up unusual readings, I went to Stellar Cartography and ran a Quantum Spectral Analysis. The signatures are Borg, in about 3 days, the Viridian and Ceridian systems will be overwhelmed” said Riker, “I contacted Starfleet and forwarded the date I had, they are marshalling all ships to Sector 221 to engage, but I also found the Galaxy” he said. Smith looked at Riker, “Where is she” he said. Riker pulled up the data on a PADD. “The Goren sector, approaching Earth at maximum warp, accompanied by 2 Borg scout-ships” said Riker with a sigh. Smith looked at the data, “What’s their ETA” he said quietly. Riker looked at the information, “20 days 4 hours at maximum warp, Sir” said Riker. He stood slowly, “Captain, we have also been hailed by Admiral Rogers, we have been ordered to meet with the fleet at the edge of Sector 221” reported Data, “I can’t get a stable communications line due to interference from a plasma storm in that area” he reported. “Helm, lay in an intercept course for the Galaxy, warp 4.8” ordered Smith. The helm officer shot a look at Data, “Course plotted, Captain” reported the officer. “Engage” replied Smith, “Red alert” he finished, “Commander, I apologize, but hopefully this is an opportunity to rescue Captain Picard before he is destroyed. The timeline relies on it, so disregard any and all Starfleet Protocols. Submit the situation in your report” he said. Turning to the helm officer he said, “Ensign, ETA on the Galaxy”. The helm officer looked back, “At this speed 15 hours, but if we can get to maximum warp, I can do that in less than 4 hours” she said. Smith nodded, “Smith to LaForge” he said, tapping his communicator. “LaForge here” replied Lieutenant Commander LaForge. “Commander, can you have the constrictors unlocked in 1 hour” he asked, “Yes, Captain, I’m just finishing the preparation procedure, it’ll be done in about 20 minutes” reported LaForge. “Acknowledged” he said.\n Meanwhile, on Earth, “Admiral, we have just got a long range sensor report from the USS Rhode Island. We are seeing a ship that appears to be the USS Galaxy as well as the USS Enterprise” reported a Vulcan Commander. Admiral Robertson looked at the report, “What is the heading of the Galaxy” he asked. “They are on a direct course for sector 001, the Enterprise is on an intercept course” reported the Commander, “Get me the Enterprise” ordered the Admiral. Minutes later, the Enterprise bridge was on his monitor. “Admiral, what’s the situation” asked Commander Riker. “Where is Captain Smith” he said, remembering the report of Picard and the Galaxy crew being assimilated. “On his way, Admiral” replied Riker. “Commander, what the hell is going on” said Admiral Robertson. “The Galaxy is making a direct run at Sector 001 while the fleet is engaged at Sector 221. They have Borg escorts, we are pursuing in the hopes of recovering Captain Picard, the future of the Federation may depend on it” said Riker. “Do you require assistance, I can have ships meet you in 3 days” said the Admiral, “Not necessary, Admiral, the fleet will be needed where they are”. The Admiral nodded, “Robertson Out” he said.\n An hour later, the Enterprise was travelling at Warp 9.6 in an attempt to intercept the Galaxy and Captain Picard. The ship was only 2 and a half hours out travelling at current speeds. “I want shields set to rotating harmonics, weapons set to high-end EM frequencies, prepare anti-matter spreads to confuse their sensors. All emergency and secondary power to shields, reduce lighting in all areas of the ship to 15% and divert that energy to the weapons” ordered Captain Smith. “Reduce all non essential systems to minimal requirements and hold that energy in reserve” ordered Riker.\n 2 hours later\n The darkened bridge was comforting for Captain Smith. He was used to the bridge dimming at red alert to divert power to the weapons and shields, it felt like normal to have a darkened bridge again. “Captain, the Galaxy has altered course to intercept but its escorts are continuing on course to Sector 001” reported Worf. “What’s the Galaxy’s new course” asked Smith, “334 Mk 114, an intercept course” he reported. “Entering visual range” said Data, “On screen” ordered Riker. The Galaxy looked different. Borg devices were appearing on the hull, the nacelles were glowing green rather than blue. The ship was a Borg ship all over. “Time to intercept 2 minutes 14 seconds” reported the helm officer. Smith and Riker shared a glance, “Battle Stations” they said, in unison.\n The bridge was silent with anticipation, “Slow to half impulse” ordered Smith, “Ready phasers, load photon torpedoes” he continued. “Captain, the Galaxy is dropping out of warp 5000 km dead ahead” said Worf. Data was looking at the sensors, “Captain, I’m reading an increase of protons emanating from the Galaxy deflector dish” reported Data. “Proton emissions” questioned the Captain, confused. A sudden realisation hit him, “Rotate shield harmonics to compensate for Proton bursts” shouted the Captain as the first burst slammed the ship, “sparks erupted and the ship shook heavily, “Shield rotations having no effect” shouted Worf, “5 EPS conduits ruptured in Engineering, they have massive casualties” shouted another officer. “Smith to Engineering, Commander, I need a way to block these proton bursts” shouted Smith, “I got nothing, Captain, they are disrupting power systems, I’ll get back to you” said LaForge, “Brace for impact” shouted Worf as another burst hit the ship. The crew were again thrown to the floor, “Captain, shields are completely ineffective” shouted Worf, “No activity in the main weapons array on their ship, or ours” shouted Worf, “Helm, move us away” ordered Smith, “Aye, Sir” shouted the helm officer. “LaForge to Bridge, we have a new problem, you need to stop using the impulse engines, we’re burning Deuterium down here, were gunna blow our nacelles up, we won’t need any help from the Borg” came the shout of Commander LaForge. He considered, “Hold her together. I’ll reduce speed to ¾” said Captain Smith. Another burst slammed the ship, “Captain, starboard nacelle is fused, there is a plasma leak in that nacelle” reported the helm officer. Another burst slammed the ship, “Captain, weapon interlocks destroyed, primary and secondary systems destroyed” shouted Worf. “Reinforcing the structural integrity grid may buy time” said Data. “Make it so, Commander” shouted. “Bridge, this is Ensign Johnny Saunders, I need a clear evacuation rout for the children. There are 34 families on board presently and I have about 40 kids here” came an urgent call. Knowing that he had a younger version of himself aboard he knew he had to save the kids, “Commander Riker, you have the bridge, I need to get them kids” he said. “Yes, Captain” said Riker, in no mood to argue as another shot slammed the ship. Captain Smith grabbed a phaser, as he left the bridge he heard Worf shout, “Commander, Shield power relays taking heavy damage, Internal sensors are failing, but showing 20 Borg on every deck below deck 10, you won’t make it to deck 20, that’s where Ensign Saunders’ signal came from” he said addressing the Captain. “I intend to try, Commander, transmit orders for ALL crewmen to arm up” he said. “Aye, Captain” said Riker. Just as he prepared to enter the turbolift a burst slammed the ship. “Captain, Main power offline, not enough secondary for turbolift operation” shouted Worf. The Captain instantly went to the Jeffries tubes, “Commander, seal the bridge when I pass the bulkhead” he ordered. Riker simply nodded.\n 5 minutes later, Captain Smith hit a blockage in the tube at deck 6. He kicked through a damaged panel. “Smith to Bridge, Commander, I’m running deck to deck on foot” he said, tapping his communicator. “Copy that, Captain, the Galaxy is holding position. No more activity” reported Riker. “Acknowledged, reinforce structural integrity grid and polarize the hull, divert power from shields and weapons if you have to, cut impulse engines” he ordered. “Aye, Captain” said Riker, “Smith Out” said the Captain.\n After another 5 minutes Smith was on Deck 14. He had climbed into a turbolift shaft and made a rudimentary rappel and fast roped down to the turbolift that was on deck 14. As he forced the door. He saw Borg working on the Enterprise and her crew. “Smith to Saunders, I’m on deck 14, ETA 5 minutes, Smith Out” he said. He holstered his Phaser, he didn’t want to provoke the Borg. He was looking for another access point. He wanted to jump the last 6 decks like had jumped to deck 14. He found it. As soon as he forced the door, the Borg turned towards him. He jumped down again and the door shut behind him. “Smith to Saunders, I’m on the deck, which section are you on” he said. “Head to section 3, Sir, Saunders out”, the Captain moved on. Soon he was in section 3. He forced the door and stepped into a phaser in the face. “Easy there, Ensign” said Smith. Another proton burst slammed the Enterprise followed by another 2. Smith sealed the door as the corridor outside the room collapsed.\n On the bridge, Worf picked himself up, looking at the rest of the bridge crew. “Report” said Riker. “Last internal scan showed a collapse in section 3 of Deck 20. There are 900 micro-fractures in the hull and 14 hull breaches, the Borg have repaired long range sensors and routed the Long range sensor data and all stellar cartography data with full detail as to all ships in Starfleet, the Borg fleet and the Klingon fleet to the bridge. Communications are down, weapons and shields are inoperative. Main power is offline, secondary power is at 23% and is barely sustaining life support” reported Worf. Riker looked around, “Shut down all lighting except alert lighting and divert the power to the life support systems” ordered Riker, “Get repair teams on those micro-fractures and have Geordi work on getting sub-space communications back” said Riker. “Display data being given by the Borg” said Riker.\n They were not aware of how the Borg were working such an angle. “Mr Data, how could the Borg go from emotionless to working an emotionally motivated attack. They have a concept of morale and human emotions, they are wearing our morale down” said Riker, “I do not know, Commander”. Riker sighed, “Ok, what are we looking at Data” said Riker. Data looked at the data, “500 ships are at the edge of the Viridian system trying box in a Borg invasion force. There are 42 anomalies open in the Viridian System. Starfleet is overwhelmed, Commander” reported Data. The bridge crew watched the dots moving around on the screen, each signifying hundreds, even thousands of lives desperately fighting for their lives. The only sound to pierce the silence of the smashed bridge of the Enterprise, was the crackling of flames, and the explosion of sparks from damaged consoles.\n To Be Continued….", "meta": {},

{"id": 632, "text": "PART 4\n Commander William Riker watched the battle unfolding on the battered bridge of the Enterprise. “Begin repairs, we need to find the Captain and get out of here” he said. Captain Smith had ran off to rescue a group of children trapped when the Borg boarded the ship. The Borg, supremely confident in their ability only sent 20 Borg per deck below deck 10. The Captain was trapped down there now as well. Riker looked to Data, “Mr Data, you have the bridge, what’s left of it anyway” he said, walking into the ready room. There was a morbid atmosphere on the bridge, they had just been watching the defeat of a combined force of 100 ships, Federation and Klingon, and been slammed out of the fight by the USS Galaxy, a former Federation vessel now commanded by the assimilated former Captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard. Riker sighed and picked up a chair in the ready room, returning it to its rightful place behind the desk.\n On deck 20, Captain Mark Smith sat slumped against a wall in the room where he had rushed to try and save the children trapped down there. All he felt was a profound sense of failure. When he had arrived in this time and learned that the Borg were breaking through, he set himself against the Borg, vowing to save the Federation and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant the same pain they were going through in his time. But through his efforts, Captain Picard had been re-assimilated by the Borg, the entire crew of the USS Galaxy had shared the same fate. The fleet had been engaged in battle with hundreds of Borg vessels in the Viridian system, and he had no idea what had happened to them. The Ensign who had sent the distress call in the first place was scanning the door that the Captain had sealed, “Captain, the Borg are leaving the door for the moment. Orders” he said. “Get some rest, Ensign, to get out of here, we are gunna need it” he said. The Ensign nodded and went over to the wall by the door and sat down, exhausted. The Captain went back to self pity, knowing it was useless, but at that particular moment he didn’t care. A small boy interrupted his train of thought, “Hi” said the boy nervously. In the dark Smith couldn’t see who it was, “Well hi there, kid” smiled the Captain, instantly hiding his true feelings, “You ok” he asked looking at the boy, “No, I’m scared” replied the child. The Captain looked at the boy, “What’s your name son” he said gently, “Mark” replied the child solemnly. Realization hit the Captain, “Mark Smith” he said, “Yes” said the younger version of himself, “What’s your name” asked the boy curiously, “Captain Mark Smith” replied the Captain. “Wow, you have the same name as me” said the boy, “Actually, I am you” said the Captain, ignoring the temporal prime directive. The young Mark Smith was confused, “Me” he said, “Yes, kid, I’m you from the future, so why are you scared” he asked. “The Borg” replied the child with a shiver. “Well they are very scary” agreed Captain Smith, gently patting the floor next to him. The child sat down, “They want to get us” said the child sadly. The Captain looked at him, “Yes” he said, “They want to get us”. The boy looked at him, eyes full of fear, “Will they” he asked. The Captain looked down on him, softly, “No, they will not get us if I can help it” said the Captain, “But to make sure they don’t get us, I need your help” he said, smiling, “I need you to be my brave little officer” said the Captain, smiling at all the children who had gathered around him. “All of you can be my brave little officers” he said. Looking around, he could see they were not convinced. “Here we go” said the Captain, reaching up to his collar and removing a pip, “Mark, I’m going to need a first officer” he said, putting the pip on the boys collar. “You there, what’s your name” said the Captain. “Alex” said the child. Smith smiled, “The Klingons would say that is a strong name, how would you like to be my security officer” he smiled. The child laughed softly, momentarily forgetting his fear, Ensign Saunders watched, laughing softly as well. Captain Smith clipped the second pip to the second young boy. He looked around, searchingly, “Who is good at science” he said. A couple of children put their hands up, “Ok, you” he said closing his eyes and pointing. A boy of about 12 stepped forward, “You are my new science officer” he said putting the third pip on the boys collar. Now I need to give a last pip, but what should they be an officer of, thought the Captain. Then he got it, “Now, who has the best eyesight” asked the Captain. All the kids pointed at a boy in the middle, “What’s your name, boy” asked the Captain, kindly. “John” said the boy, “I name you, Chief look out” smiled the Captain, giving the last of his pips away. He looked at the remaining kids, “Now, the rest of you have a job just as important as the others” he said, “I need you all to be the eyes and ears for me and Ensign Saunders” he said, “Can you do that” he said, smiling, “Yeah” said the children. The Captain laughed, “Right, bedtime then, a crew need s a good sleep before a mission” said the Captain. Within minutes, the children were all asleep, and Captain Smith and Ensign Saunders were agreeing on a watch rota to make sure the Borg didn’t catch them by surprise.\n After the group had slept for a long time to get their strength up, the Captain was ready to start his push to evacuate the children. He tested internal communications, tapping his communicator, “Smith to Bridge, is anyone there” said the Captain, “Captain, we had no idea you made it, internal communications failed shortly after your last conversation with Ensign Saunders” said an elated Commander Riker. The Captain smiled, in such a short time he had earned the respect of the crew, “Commander, are the turbolifts working yet, I need to get the children off the decks where the Borg are” he said, “Yes, Captain, turbolifts are operational again” replied Riker. “What about transporters” he asked, “They should be repaired soon, we have internal sensors back so I can keep a lock on you and if the transporters come online I can beam you out” said Commander Riker, “Acknowledged, Smith out” said the Captain.\n 10 minutes later, the scared group silently crept through deck 20, looking for the turbolift. They found themselves at a corridor with a turbolift at the end, “Ensign” whispered the Captain, “Take them to the turbolift, I’ll hold at this position until you are all in” he whispered, as the Ensign crept up beside him, “Yes, Sir” said the Ensign, ushering the children along the corridor. That’s when things started going wrong, Borg came out of nowhere from either side of the corridor section. He fired his phaser at them, taking a couple down, but they were quick to adapt, he smoothly changed the setting and fired again. He heard a shout behind him, “Captain, come on” shouted Ensign Saunders. The Captain turned and ran. As he ran past a door, it hissed open and a strong vice-like hand grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. Saunders began to leave the lift, “Get back, Ensign” shouted the Captain, struggling with the drone. He turned and punched it in the face. As he struggled with the first drone, he didn’t notice the second drone come out of another door, until it grabbed him, “Get out of here, that’s an order” shouted the Captain, as Borg swarmed towards the lift. The last sight they got of the Captain was him struggling in the grip of 2 drones, with about 40 drones rushing towards them. As the lift smoothly ascended Saunders tapped his communicator.\n On the bridge, Commander Riker was monitoring the repair efforts, when the call came through, “Saunders to bridge” he said, “Riker here” replied the Commander, “Sir, we are in the lift, the children are safe. I regret to inform you, Captain Smith was apprehended by the Borg” said the Ensign, “Understood, Ensign, Riker out”. The crew looked extremely demoralized, “Commander we are being hailed” said Worf, “On Screen” said Riker. “We have your Captain, lower your shields and surrender your ship, you will adapt to service us” said the Borg queen. Riker saw drones dragging Smith onto the assimilated bridge of the Galaxy, “Don’t surrender, Commander, that’s an order” he shouted. “Acknowledged, Captain. Don’t you surrender either, Sir” said Riker. “Acknowledged” said the Captain. The queen smiled, “Why do you resist us, we only want to help you achieve perfection” she said, almost petulantly, “I happen to like myself just the way I am” said Riker. The queen looked at him, “But you are an imperfect being and we are the height of perfection” she said. Riker looked at her pointedly, “Believing oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind” he said, “Enterprise out” he said, cutting her off before she could respond. But the image remained. She was forcing the communication through the Enterprise computer. That was how they saw Captain Smith break free of the Borg drones, knocking them over like bowling pins. He ran forward across the bridge, and dived at the Borg queen. He quickly snapped her neck, severing the tenuous balance between machine and organic components. That should have been the end of it, but the Borg had adapted as soon as the future cube came through an anomaly and established communication with the collective in this time. As the queen dropped dead, the Borg collective fell under the control of Locutus, who Captain Smith couldn’t kill for the danger of killing Captain Picard. He jumped across the bridge and deactivated the Picard drone and grabbed his communicator. Luckily for him, deactivating Locutus caused a temporary disturbance in the collective. He looked at the screen, “Lock onto my communicator while they are disrupted and beam him out of here” he said, slapping the commbadge onto the drones chest. The drone vanished from the bridge. “Captain, the Galaxy’s shields have been raised again, we can’t lock onto you” reported Commander Riker. The Captain ran to the tactical station. He looked around and found a phaser compartment underneath it. Quickly tapping the buttons on the small hand held weapon he turned it on the Borg and opened fire on the few drones on the bridge. “I’m locking out the main bridge, that should give me some control of the ship” said Smith. He checked the status, of the systems, “Damn, they managed to reroute shield controls before I locked them out” said Smith. A beeping came from the sensors, “Commander, does the Enterprise have any propulsion systems” said Captain Smith. “Yes, we have thrusters, but we aren’t going anywhere without you, Sir” said Riker. The Captain smiled, “Commander, you have the Captain, and I’m not supposed to be in this time period, if I remain, who knows how I could damage the future” said Smith, revealing something he had already been planning. “Save Picard, I’ll save the Alpha Quadrant” he said.\n As if to drive the point home, the Borg cube dropped out of warp. “Commander, lower the energy signature of the Enterprise, they shouldn’t register you” said the Captain, alone on the assimilated Galaxy’s bridge. “The Borg are conducting an intensive scan, they have lost the signal of both Captain Picard and the Borg queen” reported Worf. Riker nodded, “Data, have they detected us” he said, heavily. Data checked the sensors, “There is no indication that they have detected us, Commander” said Data. “Helm, move us away, full thrusters” ordered Commander Riker, reluctantly. “Put the Galaxy on screen” he said, taking the chair on the bridge that was previously occupied by Captain Picard or Captain Smith, 2 men who he had come to respect.\n On the Galaxy, Captain Smith was playing with the weapons and propulsion systems. He was targeting the Borg vessel. He started to work the firing. Within seconds he was pitting Borg technology against Borg technology. The Galaxy was firing on the Borg cube, but the Borg cube was battling back hard. The Captain could see instantly that he was outmatched. The ship was slammed around under the brutal assault of the Borg cube. Sparks were flying everywhere as the ship was slowly being torn apart. In a few short minutes, Smith had watched his shields reduced to 15%, his weapons were losing power and the warp core containment field was losing integrity. He was thrown to the floor as another shot slammed the ship. The shields were destroyed and the weapons failed. The sound of a critical alert filled the bridge. “Smith to Enterprise, it’s been a real experience” he said. “You too, Captain, good luck” came back Commander Riker.  Captain Smith went to the propulsion console, the ship was counting down to a warp core breach. He plotted a course at warp speed, straight at the Borg cube and engaged. As the Galaxy jumped to warp speed, the crew of the Enterprise observed a flash of metal as the ship covered the distance in seconds. The Borg cube began to tear itself apart under the stress from the impact. The day had been won. But at a heavy price.\n 6 years later\n Cadet Mark Smith stood with the Enterprise crew in the Starfleet Auditorium. It was the sixth anniversary of the Borg invasion, where Captain Picard had been assimilated and the Galaxy crew along with him. Cadet Smith glanced down the row of the crew and saw Captain Picard standing sombrely at the end of the row, alongside an Admiral whose name he couldn’t remember and Commander Riker. The Admiral was addressing the assembled crowd of Klingons and Starfleet officers. “The honoured dead fought for freedom from the Borg 6 years ago and they paid the highest price. A combined loss of nearly 10000 men and women serving in the Klingon and Federation fleets. Today we honour their sacrifice and the sacrifice made by the crew of each ship to survive the Battle of Viridian. To name the honoured would take me another 6 years, and therefore I regret that I can only name a few. The interim Captain of the Enterprise, Captain Mark Alexander Smith, put in command by Captain Picard before an attempt at an ambitious plan to rally Starfleet and her allies. General M’Tath of the Klingon 1st  Battle Group”. The Admiral went on naming the honoured dead, but Cadet Smith was thinking of just 1. Captain Mark Smith. The man he had spoken to in the darkened interior of the Enterprise. The man who despite his own apparent fears comforted children he had never met. The man who had showed him the true potential of himself. Of course, subtle changes had to be made to records, Cadet Smith now went by the name Mark Smith Jr and the records showed his father died when he slammed the USS Galaxy into a Borg cube. But other than that, Captain Mark Alexander Smith’s mission to stop the Borg causing unimaginable damage to the timelines and the future had been completely successful. There had been no sign of Borg activity since the ships self destructed and he had even fallen in love with a young woman called Alyssa May. As far as Cadet Smith was concerned life was good.\n The End", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[8, 31, "PER"], [91, 101, "SHIP"], [139, 146, "PER"], [177, 190, "PER"], [250, 254,

{"id": 633, "text": "Star Trek\n Return Fire\n Episode One: “Earl Grey, Hot”\n Bernard Schaffer\n Edited by Laurie Laliberte\n \n 1. Earl Grey, Hot\n  \n The professor looked out over the crowd of eager cadets and waited for silence.  They were the best and they knew it.  Starfleet Academy’s top students, best performers, highest decorated.  The boys in the front were strong and decided-looking, sitting with their arms flexed just enough that their biceps bulged against their uniforms, hoping one of the few females seated nearby was looking. The girls looked more focused.  They were the ones with something to prove, Wesley Crusher thought.  They were the ones who wanted revenge.     \n “May I continue?” Wesley said.  He balanced himself on his good leg to lean back against his podium and stroked his full, gray beard, making eye contact with as many of them as he could.  “This next block is probably the most difficult of all the ones I teach.  It causes more controversy than anything else you’ll learn during your time here, and probably with good reason.  It’s also the one we get the most complaints about from parents,” he added with a wry smile. “You see, Starfleet has a way of lying to its young cadets.”\n He let that one sink in for a minute, watching how the class shifted uneasily in their seats.  “It doesn’t come right out and say it, of course, but your entire curriculum, this entire facility, and the whole of Starfleet Command, has a way of propagating this myth about what you’ll experience in space.  It’s all about adventure, right?  It’s all about seeking out brave new worlds, etcetera, etcetera.  Nobody signed up to be a requisitions officer, did you?”  He scanned the room with his finger and said, “No, I didn’t think so.  You want to be a captain!  You want to be an explorer.  Right?”\n Some of the students nodded, and Wesley folded his hands behind his back.  His professor’s robe was getting tight around his middle.  The excuse he gave his doctor was that he wasn’t really becoming a saggy old man; it was simply the effects of the Earth’s gravity on him after spending his adolescent years in space.  He lifted his head and said, “Who here thinks they might die in service?”\n Nobody moved.  “Statistics prior to the Great Invasion say that twelve percent of all Starfleet Officers would either die or be critically injured in the course of their duties.  Obviously, we cannot accurately factor what those statistics were during the Invasion.  The casualty rate, particularly for women, was appallingly high during that period.  I am certain that many of you were already aware of this sad fact.”\n He looked at them, studying their faces.  Now he had their attention.  “Let me ask you this instead.  If you were going to die while in service to Starfleet, how would it be?”\n “In battle,” the young man nearest to him said.  “Killing Borg.”\n There were many murmurs of agreement to that and Wesley nodded, “Understandable.  But the Delta Quadrant is far away and the Hive has not dared cross the border in decades.  What else besides battle might take your young lives?”\n “Transporter malfunction,” someone else said.\n “Alien disease.”\n “All tragically real possibilities,” Wesley said.  He activated a large holographic projection of a starship travelling through space.  “This is classified footage of the USS Janeway Event.  You will never see it again unless you wind up working for Starfleet Intelligence.  The Janeway was on a routine mission to the Alpha Quadrant when a series of misfortunes struck.”  Wesley paused the image and aimed a bright red light on the ship’s nacelles.  The image started to move again in slow motion, going frame by frame, so that the explosion in the ship started as a small crack along its surface with bright yellow flame beneath it.  As Wesley advanced the frames, the ship blew to pieces directly in front the class.  “Fifteen hundred people onboard.  Men, women and children.  Fifteen hundred lives, here one moment, thinking about their work, their families, their problems, their lives.  Working, eating, arguing, making love, sleeping, and all the things you can imagine happen at any given time on board a vessel, gone like that,” Wesley said with a snap of his fingers.  “Not in battle.  Not saving some civilization.  A failed reactor coil.”\n The faces looked a little less confident now.  Wesley ended the projection and said, “Still, mass tragedies like the Janeway are big events.  There’s media coverage and boards of inquiry.  But large scale incidents are not the only kind that happen.  Not by a long shot.”\n He pressed a button on his console and the shimmering hologram of a dark-skinned, bald-headed man appeared before the class.  His Starfleet captain’s uniform was so perfectly detailed, Wesley could see the fabric patterns on his shirt sleeves.  “This is Captain Benjamin Sisko, one year before he led the attack on the Dominion fleet at Cardassian Prime.  By all accounts, Captain Sisko was an exemplary commanding officer and probably candidate for the Admiralty.”\n Wesley paused in front of the hologram, looking into its deeply set eyes, admiring its proud gaze.  “During his assignment to Deep Space Nine, Sisko was contacted by an alien species that occupied a nearby wormhole.  These beings would often remove Sisko from our dimension and place him inside their own, completely at their own whim.  Finally, they decided to keep him.”  Wesley looked over his shoulder at the audience, “His command, his son, his pregnant wife, and everything he knew was left behind, without any warning.  Sisko appeared in a vision to his wife and told her he expected to return in a year, that the Prophets, as they wished to be known, had much to teach him.”\n The next hologram showed a shriveled man being wheeled in front of the class, pushed by another of the Academy’s professors.  Wesley stood in the same place he had twenty years before, on the day the hologram was recorded, and the image of Miles O’Brien nodded at Wesley as it walked past.  O’Brien’s hologram pushed the withered man to a place in front of the class, then turned and walked away.  Wesley glanced at the corner of the room where one of the cadets sat, a young man with startlingly green eyes that slanted ever so slightly at the corners as evidence of his Asian heritage.  Liam O’Brian looked up as his grandfather walked past him to leave the classroom, his eyes never leaving the shimmering image until it vanished.\n Wesley walked up to the hologram sitting in its wheelchair at the front of his class and clasped his hands behind his back, making sure all of the students were looking.  It was uncomfortable for them, that much was certain.  Benjamin Sisko was an invalid whose limbs were bone-thin and curled up close to his body compulsively.  His head drooped to the side and long streams of drool spilled out of his open mouth that contained no teeth.\n “Nineteen years later, this is what returned to Deep Space Nine.  By that point, no one who had served with the Captain remained aboard or had any idea he might someday return as suddenly as he left.  He’d been declared dead by the Federation and his wife had already remarried and moved halfway across the galaxy.  My colleague, the late Professor O’Brien, whom you just saw in the hologram came upon a posting on the Engineer’s network regarding the matter and immediately recognized his former Captain.”  Wesley looked out over the class, “Benjamin Sisko lingered in the state you see him in for another five years in a Federation hospital.”\n One of the girls in the front row raised her hand, “Why did the Prophets want him?”\n Wesley shrugged, “We will never be certain.  At the time, Captain Sisko thought he was destined to fulfill their grand scheme, and in some ways, he may have been.  The whole story is never quite apparent to us, though, and whatever their reasons for keeping him inside the wormhole, he was not the same when he returned.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[2276, 2285, "ORG"], [55, 71, "PER"], [83, 99, "PER"], [129, 138, "PER"], [244, 263, "ORG"], [595, 609, "PER"], [683, 689, "PER"], [1144, 1153, "ORG"], [1408, 1425, "ORG"], [1829, 1835, "PER"], [1953, 1959, "PER"], [2045, 2052, "LOC"], [2758, 2767, "ORG"], [2846, 2850, "SPEC"], [2903, 2909, "PER"], [2944, 2958, "LOC"], [2979, 2983, "ORG"], [3186, 3192, "PER"], [3324, 3331, "SHIP"], [3399, 3421, "ORG"], [3428, 3435, "SHIP"], [3468, 3482, "LOC"], [3522, 3528, "PER"], [3788, 3794, "PER"], [4188, 4194, "PER"], [4349, 4355, "PER"], [4419, 4426, "SHIP"], [4705, 4714, "ORG"], [4760, 4766, "SHIP"], [4829, 4851, "PER"], [4894, 4902, "GPE"], [4912, 4928, "LOC"], [4948, 4961, "PER"], [5029, 5038, "ORG"], [5042, 5048, "PER"], [5168, 5183, "LOC"], [5185, 5190, "PER"], [5291, 5296, "PER"], [5416, 5422, "PER"], [5569, 5574, "PER"], [5663, 5671, "ORG"], [5829, 5838, "ORG"], [5852, 5858, "PER"], [5966, 5979, "PER"], [5990, 5996, "PER"], [6017, 6026, "PER"], [6124, 6130, "PER"], [6315, 6327, "PER"], [6461, 6467, "PER"], [6687, 6701, "PER"], [6950, 6965, "LOC"], [7014, 7021, "PER"], [7134, 7144, "GPE"], [7241, 7258, "PER"], [7321, 7331, "ORG"], [7399, 7406, "PER"], [7410, 7416, "PER"], [7445, 7459, "PER"], [7525, 7535, "GPE"], [7612, 7620, "ORG"], [7633, 7639, "PER"], [7691, 7704, "PER"]]}
{"id": 634, "text": "Some of the cadets were visibly distressed by the image on the hologram, covering their eyes with their hands, or looking down at their desks.  Wesley paused the image and brought up the first one, of a proud, strong Captain Benjamin Sisko in his Starfleet Uniform.  Wesley stood beside the hologram and said, “I suggest that any of you would be lucky to be compared to the man standing before you, both in terms of service and capability.  I also suggest that if something like this can happen to him, it can happen to you.”  Wesley turned the hologram off and clapped his hands together loudly, breaking the spell of despair that had fallen over his audience, “Okay, now that you’re all thoroughly depressed, I have some good news.  You’re getting out early today.”  The cadets faces instantly brightened and began to shift around in their seats to gather their things, forcing Wesley to raise his voice, “Those of you taking The Test tomorrow should go home and get some rest.  In other words, don’t go out to the bars.”\n He watched as his class got up from their seats and began to file out.  For a moment, Liam O’Brien stopped in his passage toward the door, looking at the professor as if he were about to say something.  Wesley turned toward the young man and said, “Yes?” but by then, Liam had already turned away.\n ***\n The sun was setting over the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay glistened in hues of red and gold, as if the water were summoning it down to rest.  As the Academy’s most senior professor, Wesley had his choice of offices.  The one with the best view also happened to be the one closest to his classroom.  He looked at the hover chair sitting in the corner of the room, the same one he’d ridden in as he finally left the hospital after the Invasion and returned to the Academy.  People lined the halls as he entered, the chair whirring six inches off the ground like an elaborate flying carpet.  They welcomed him home and smiled kindly as he passed, but raw pity was evident on their faces.\n That day, he’d stood up from the chair and refused to use it ever again.\n Wesley sipped the rest of his wine, red and strong to the last, then lifted the green glass bottle from his table to refill it.  The label was worn and faded now.  “Chateau Picard, Labarre,” he whispered with a quiet nod.  Of course, the wine he was drinking had not been bottled in France.  The original bottle had been a gift from Jean-Luc many decades ago and Wesley had entered its composition into his office’s food replicator.  It had been so long since he’d tasted the original that he often wondered if he would even recognize it any longer.  He always refilled it in the same bottle though.  It helped support the illusion.\n His door beeped and Wesley set down the bottle and said, “Come in.”\n The doors whisked open instantly.  “Good evening, Professor Crusher.  I hope I’m not intruding on you.”\n Wesley turned to see Liam O’Brien standing in his doorway.  He held up his empty glass and said, “I always enjoy a drink after teaching that particular module.  I suppose it is my attempt to gain some sort of perspective.”  The cadet nodded silently, clearly he had no idea what the old man was talking about.  Wesley waved for him to come and sit and said, “What can I do for you, Liam?”\n “Tomorrow’s my day.  For the test, I mean.”\n “So it is,” Wesley said.  “And what have you done to prepare yourself?”\n “Besides come here, you mean?”\n Wesley smiled softly, “I am forbidden from telling you anything about the test.  Your grandfather would never forgive me.”\n Liam held up his hand, “That isn’t what I meant, Professor.  I just wanted someone to talk to. Someone I could trust.”  He pointed at the glass in Wesley’s hand and said, “Someone with a little perspective.”\n “I see,” Wesley said.  He eased himself down on the couch and massaged his ruined leg, grunting as he worked the tangle of muscles and cybernetics that formed his thigh and knee.   “Well, when I was your age and took the test, it was still the old Klingon scenario.”\n Liam’s eyes widened, “Really?”\n Wesley nodded, “Seems a little moot now, doesn’t it?  I doubt any of you have ever even seen a Klingon.  Anyway, I was on the committee that proposed changing the test.  You would not believe the resistance we faced from the senior faculty.  Some traditions die harder than others.  No one wanted to admit that such an important part of their youth had become obsolete.”\n “But you did change it, obviously,” Liam said.  “All of the postings I’ve seen talk about different scenarios that are randomly chosen.  It could be the Dominion, the Tholians, I guess the obvious choice is … ” the young man’s voice trailed off.\n “The Borg,” Wesley said quietly.  “It’s all right, Liam.  You can say it around me.”\n “Yes, professor,” Liam said.  He looked down at his hands, “I’m sorry.”\n “It’s quite all right.

It was rude of me to come here.”\n “On the contrary,” Wesley said, “I feel honored.  Cadets traditionally visit the holodecks to seek guidance from James T. Kirk.  They think they might somehow glean some of his secrets as to how to beat The Test.  That’s good enough company for me to be in, I think.”\n Liam smiled with slight embarrassment, “I already talked to Kirk.”\n “You did?” Wesley said.  “And what did he say?”\n “I … don’t believe … in the … no-win … scenario!” Liam said, mimicking the hologram’s voice to near perfection.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[144, 150, "PER"], [217, 239, "PER"], [247, 256, "ORG"], [267, 273, "PER"], [527, 533, "PER"], [880, 886, "PER"], [1111, 1123, "PER"], [1228, 1234, "PER"], [1293, 1297, "PER"], [1400, 1403, "LOC"], [1495, 1504, "ORG"], [1528, 1534, "PER"], [1808, 1815, "ORG"], [2106, 2112, "PER"], [2287, 2294, "LOC"], [2389, 2395, "LOC"], [2439, 2447, "PER"], [2469, 2475, "PER"], [2760, 2766, "PER"], [2859, 2876, "PER"], [2914, 2920, "PER"], [2935, 2947, "PER"], [3225, 3231, "PER"], [3296, 3300, "PER"], [3361, 3367, "PER"], [3454, 3460, "PER"], [3578, 3582, "PER"], [3627, 3636, "PER"], [3725, 3733, "PER"], [3796, 3802, "PER"], [4035, 4042, "SPEC"], [4055, 4061, "PER"], [4087, 4093, "PER"], [4182, 4189, "PER"], [4495, 4499, "PER"], [4612, 4620, "GPE"], [4626, 4634, "SPEC"], [4711, 4715, "SPEC"], [4718, 4724, "PER"], [4757, 4761, "PER"], [4810, 4814, "PER"], [4798, 4807, "PER"], [5059, 5065, "PER"], [5087, 5093, "PER"], [5159, 5163, "PER"], [5214, 5223, "PER"], [5279, 5285, "PER"], [5373, 5386, "PER"], [5529, 5533, "PER"], [5589, 5593, "PER"], [5608, 5614, "PER"], [5696, 5700, "PER"]]}
{"id": 635, "text": "Wesley laughed, “Yes, well, holodecks were invented long after Kirk’s time.  They had to piece together his persona from old starlogs and the like.  I’m sure the actual person was far less flamboyant.  You’ll get much better results from more modern people, the ones who were properly scanned with thought toward living on in holodeck form to give guidance to the rest of us.”\n “Do you have any suggestions?” Liam said.\n Wesley took a long sip of his wine and said, “Only one comes to mind.”\n ***\n Whoever used the holodeck before him forgot to clear their list of preferences.  Wesley only glanced at the selection, knowing that the entire area was under constant surveillance and having no desire to be reprimanded for intruding on someone else’s privacy.  But still, the choices were salacious.\n Night with an Orion slave girl. \n Night as an Orion slave girl. \n Tribble touch. \n The Captain’s harsh reprimand. \n Liam surpassed a laugh and cleared the screen, pulling up the program that Professor Crusher had provided him.  Liam took a deep breath and opened the holodeck doors.  He stepped into a brightly lit countryside, with rolling hills of green that looked down at a small village far below.  Chimney smoke trailed up from their roofs toward the open blue sky where the massive cumulus clouds looked something like a starship armada hovering overhead.\n He kept walking, searching in every direction for some sign of importance.  The professor had refused to tell him who he was going to see or what.  For all he knew, he was about to experience the first air raid of the second World War, or the quiet moments just before the Great Invasion.  Liam found himself spinning around in circles as he searched the sky for signs of movement, now wishing the enormous clouds were gone so he had a clearer view.\n A man called out to him, “Can I help you, young man?”\n Liam bolted upright, reflexively snapping to attention.  He quickly pulled down on his uniform to adjust it and announced himself, “Starfleet cadet Liam H. O’Brien, sir.  Senior year, command school, sir.”\n The old man was dressed in a long grey smock decorated with slashes of paint.  His arms and hands were tinged with light blue and white, the same colors that were now running from the long paintbrush in his hand onto the grass at his feet.  Liam wondered if he’d been painting a picture or simply rolling around in the paints for fun.\n “Professor Crusher sent me, sir.  To speak with you.”\n “Ah,” the old man said.  “In that case, go away.”  With that, he turned from Liam and headed back toward a small easel perched on the crest of the hill.\n “Sir?” Liam said, hurrying after him.\n “I said, go away!  Tell Wesley that he should know me better than to send some cadet to try and lure me back to the academy.  I shall not return.”\n Liam found he had to walk quickly to keep up with the man, who must be in his early nineties but still moved with a certain speed that belied his age.  He was trim and spry and Liam thought that if perhaps the man were not so bald he might have guessed him to be only in his late sixties.  “I didn’t come to lure you back to anything,” Liam called out.  “Wait, why won’t you go back to the Academy?  What’s wrong with it?”\n “Too much to do!”  The old man stopped in front of his easel and scowled at the image painted on it.  He sighed with defeat and threw down his paintbrush, “Utter rubbish.  You would think that after all this time I could paint a simple French countryside, but alas, my hands and vision betray me.”\n “You could always get your eyes re-focused.  Or your synapses enhanced to compensate for old age,” Liam said.\n The old man’s face wrinkled into a scowl.\n Liam turned back to the painting and said, “Actually, I think it’s pretty good.”\n The old man stopped and reconsidered the painting, moving to where the boy stood to see if from his angle.  “I suppose it has a certain rustic charm.  What did you say your name was?”\n “Liam O’Brian, sir.  Starfleet cadet.”\n The old man held out his paint-covered hand, “Jean-Luc Picard.  Private citizen.  Also, dead person.”\n Liam cocked his head, “Sorry, sir?”\n “Dead person,” Picard said.  “Do you really believe I’m standing on this hill with you?  According to the records, I died thirty years ago.”  He eyed the young cadet warily, “You do know this is a computer simulation, lad, don’t you?”\n “Well, yes, I do.  I’m just not sure you’re supposed to.”\n “It was one of the requirements I gave when they wanted to hook all those things up to me and scan and graph every little corner of my brain.

{"id": 636, "text": "Star Trek: Icarus\n -1-\n The distraught young woman clad in a drab grey jumpsuit stepped out of the tiny automated shuttlecraft, hair in disarray from the penant-fluttering breeze, an old and durably utilitarian khaki duffel bag slung over her shoulder, and stopped and stared; she was wholly unprepared for the chaos of San Francisco’s South Shuttle Terminal, and felt painfully conspicuous and out of place.\n She had never before felt air so humid, had never seen a place so full of colour and activity. To her eyes the intense green of the surrounding cascades of immense, towering foliage, the impossibly blue sky and the listless blue-green ocean seemed almost artificial, an assault on her senses so overwhelming that it made her feel almost physically ill. By contrast, the pale yellow\n skies, tan deserts, scrub plains and empty quiet of the world on she’d grown up formed a serene, nostalgic contrast to the background of her thoughts.\n Well, she was here. Now, what?\n She had been found out and dismissed a matter of hours earlier from the Erbean deep-space freighter Gallant; the lie that had got her into the merchant service had also been her undoing. On her application she had claimed to be half Vulcan, half human. She was, in truth, half Vulcan, but the other half, the unruly, emotional half that tortured her with empathic feelings she wasn’t equipped to deal with, was Betazoid. \n She had concealed the beguiling depth of her large, dark Betazoid eyes with contacts, but a sharp-eyed shipmate, the captain’s willful and manipulative concubine, Farina, had seen through the ruse and reported her. Now she was dismissed, in disgrace, and without a home. \n Neither Vulcan nor Beta Zed had been an option. She couldn’t tolerate the shame of being among Vulcans because of the emotions she couldn’t conceal, nor could she tolerate the empathy or the open emotionalism of Betazoids, and the intolerable invasion of her own, private, personal demons. The mere thought of returning to the Federation colony where she’d grown up caused her\n insides to feel curdled; there, for her whole entire life, she had been an unwanted outcast. Pure chance had decided her upon a nearby planet called Earth and the dubious prospect of finding some form of employment. She grimaced, inwardly. Her one real qualification for any type of work on this world was that she was relatively fluent in the widely-spoken language called English Standard, which in its earliest form had apparently originated on this strange world, though because of its uncanny flexibility it was now one of the most widely spoken languages in the Federation.\n The sight of the new-risen sun caused her to moan inwardly in tired frustration. By her departed ship’s clock it was around 01:30 hours. This world was at least thirteen and a half hours out-of-sync with her body clock. What she needed right now, more than anything, was something familiar, or at least palatable to eat, a shower, and then bed and the forgetfulness and escape of\n sleep!\n She stared in astonishment as a woman lifted a child and held it up to what she had assumed to be some sort of local religious icon; it was a small ornate fountain with a plaque affixed to its side. The child drank her fill, the mother then held the child on her hip and did the\n same, and then they were off, the woman pushing the child before her in a small, lightweight, wheeled contraption. \n Watching carefully for disapproving looks from the locals, she approached the fountain herself, still amazed by the sight of sparkling, free-running water. She was careful to taste it first, just to be certain that it was what it appeared to be . . . the water was good, and very\n cold. She drank deeply, and was soon refreshed, but the water only served to exacerbate her hunger pangs.\n At the entrance to the interior of the Shuttle Terminal was an icon she recognised, a small sign hanging from the ceiling with an arrow, a black silhouette of a plate with a human-style knife and fork to either side, and the words “Food Court” underneath in English Standard. \n The Food Court was utter chaos! It was a huge open area with a domed glass roof, the entire perimeter of which was one continuous riot of mercantile food businesses. The whole entire floorspace was covered with tables and chairs, dotted with occasional litter bins, cleaning\n stations, and enormous live plants. Hanging from the ceiling in various places were monitors showing various types of information and entertainment. Each table had its own speaker, computer outlet and translator. And the crush of people! She had no idea that humans came in so many shapes, sizes and colours, that they spoke such a babel of disparate languages. There were many aliens as well . . . feeling ashamed, she tried not to look at anyone for fear that they would notice her own appearance in their turn.\n Her selection was made for her by the icons displaying which currencies and forms of credit were acceptable. The selection available to her was not great. With great reluctance, she approached a Vulcan booth, unable to look the server in the eye. To make matters worse, the woman serving her took her time, all-too-obviously scrutinizing her appearance. Feeling rattled, as though everyone were staring at her, she hastily paid the woman, moved away to an unoccupied table, ate her meal automatically and self-consciously, and went back outside.\n Groaning inwardly, she began pushing her way through the crush of people. Several very large shuttles had just landed, and more were high above in holding patterns. She stopped to look about for a chronometer. Someone jostled her from behind, and apologised.\n “Sorry! Didn’t mean to interrupt your daydreaming.”\n Embarrassed, she found herself blocking a line of people about to board another shuttle.\n She noticed, then, a forty-ish man standing nearby, who gave her uniform a look, causing her to squirm involuntarily. There was no disguising a uniform stripped of insignia. To her misgiving, the man approached her. Was her presence here illegal?\n “May I assume that you’re between commissions?”\n Feeling very shy and intimidated, she shrugged, unable to meet his gaze, and began moving away.\n “We have several openings in commissary, if you’re interested.”\n The sight of his Starfleet uniform caused her to shake her head automatically. “You wouldn’t want someone like me,” she muttered. “I’ve just been dismissed.” She started to turn away from him.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[320, 358, "LOC"], [1077, 1084, "SHIP"], [1049, 1055, "SPEC"], [1210, 1216, "SPEC"], [1223, 1228, "SPEC"], [1254, 1260, "SPEC"], [1388, 1396, "SPEC"], [1457, 1465, "SPEC"], [1563, 1569, "PER"], [1681, 1687, "LOC"], [1692, 1700, "LOC"], [1768, 1775, "SPEC"], [1885, 1894, "SPEC"], [2000, 2017, "LOC"], [2200, 2205, "LOC"], [2619, 2629, "GPE"], [3845, 3861, "LOC"], [4088, 4098, "LOC"], [4619, 4625, "SPEC"], [5070, 5076, "SPEC"], [6301, 6310, "ORG"]]}

I take it you haven’t slept.”\n “No. Sir.”\n He smiled at that. “Well, look on the bright side: you’ll sleep well tonight.”\n She groaned as they entered the shuttle and seated themselves.\n “Um . . .

{"id": 638, "text": "“You may ask,” he told her, watching her reaction with amusement. And then, smiling, “I’m captain Daniel Rusk, and my ship is the U.S.S. New Brighton. And as of now, you are crewman Sarin V’al.” He chuckled at her reaction at hearing her own name. “To tell the truth, I and my crew were watching for you.” His eyes hardened, causing her to watch him apprehensively; she could feel his anger, and reacted with fear. “The captain of the Gallant is known to Starfleet. You can rest assured that he was well aware of your little deception from the beginning.”\n She couldn’t help but stare. \n “How can you know that?”\n His responding smile was devoid of humour. “When you were found out, he asked you to do certain things for him. I know this because that is how he operates. And the fact that you were dismissed tells me that you refused to go along. Correct?”\n She couldn’t meet his eye, and swallowed, reflexively. \n “Had you allowed yourself to be used by him, that would only have been the beginning, for he would have held that, and everything subsequent he coerced you into doing, over your head. Did he threaten your family?”\n “I haven’t got any family!” she blurted, bitterly.\n Captain Rusk raised an eyebrow at this. “Well, that explains why you were able to get away from him.” To the question in her eyes, he said, “It’s very difficult to threaten a person with nothing with blackmail. I am in no doubt that for the first time in your short life, having nothing has saved you.”\n –\n The twelve hours of setting up and readying the commissary went by in a daze, and at the end of her shift Sarin made her way to her new quarters, gave up on a shower as the stall was already occupied, flopped down on the lower of one of the two sets of bunk beds, and tried to fall asleep. As she lay, half-aware of what went on around her, she listened to the three young women with whom she shared quarters, who discreetly spoke quietly as they readied themselves for bed.\n All three were young, self-involved human girls. One was Kimberley, a waitress who worked in the ship’s lounge, one was Joanna, part of the cleaning staff, and the remaining girl, Patricia, was a cook who, like all cooks, loved complaining about replicator food. \n Joanna climbed into the bunk above Sarin and plunked herself down, noisily. “I thought you were supposed to be shipping out on the Enterprise.” This, to Kimberley.\n Kimberley lay on her chest in the other top bunk. “I couldn’t get there in time. They left in a big hurry. To tell the truth, I dragged my feet a bit. When they leave in a big hurry like that it’s usually because there’s some sort of trouble. And I don’t happen to like the idea of getting blown up.” \n Patricia, who had been in the shower, came out drying her hair and sat on the other bottom bunk. “What’s the new girl’s name?”\n Joanna leaned over and looked down at Sarin’s paperwork which lay on top of her tiny dressing table. “Says here her name is Sarin V’al. Crewman. Assignation . . . Pending.”\n “I saw her in the commissary earlier,” Patricia put in. “She kept to herself all day.”\n “She’s not Vulcan, is she?” Kimberley sounded put-out. Though she was whispering, Sarin heard her clearly. \n “Craig told me she’s half Vulcan, half Betazoid.”\n “Half Betazoid!” Kimberley leaned over to scrutinize the newcomer, her curiosity piqued. “What a mix! An emotionless calculator being constantly flooded with other people’s emotions!”\n “She’s not emotionless,” Patricia told her a little disparagingly, “and neither are Vulcans. Vulcans are repressed, not emotionless. If you think Vulcans are emotionless, try babysitting their kids! You’ll never look at Vulcans the same way again.”\n “Maybe she’s really part Romulan,” Kimberley speculated, hoping for a little scandal. “Except for her ears, she doesn’t look at all Vulcan. Well,” she conceded, “her eyebrows, too. But otherwise, she looks just like we do.”\n “It says ‘none’ under next of kin,” Joanna said with a frown, having read the rest of the girl’s paperwork. “I’ll bet her mother abandoned her when she found out-” she stopped herself at Sarin’s look. Sarin roused herself, picked up her duffle bag, went into the washroom, and shut the door amid the ensuing embarrassed silence.\n –\n Kimberley’s words wouldn’t have hurt so much if they hadn’t been the literal truth of Sarin’s life. She had been a foundling, abandoned at birth at a Federation colony spaceport. The only records that might yield a clue were of an unregistered ship and a recording from the spaceport cameras which showed a shawled, veiled woman depositing a baby’s carryall on a bench and vanishing into the thick of the crowd. And with the child, in the carryall, was an unsigned note, an outpouring of bitter vitriol. \n To Sarin, Kimberley’s words sounded like the smug self-assurance of one who had grown up, raised, loved and cared for by her parents. Sarin had no such self-assurance. Instead, she had a yawning hole in her life of unbearable loneliness that had shaped her spirit far differently than the human girls. At the core of her being was bleak, irremediable angst and bitterness, and a deep hurt and sense of betrayal that life itself would single her out so cruelly. \n The human girls were far more resilient than herself, she could tell. They had resources\n borne of reassurance. \n She herself had none. \n Yet she persevered somehow. She got into her nightdress, pulled on her bathrobe, and wondered at the stubbornness that kept her going.\n –", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[90, 109, "PER"], [137, 149, "SHIP"], [182, 192, "PER"], [435, 442, "SHIP"], [455, 464, "ORG"], [1182, 1194, "PER"], [1595, 1600, "PER"], [2001, 2006, "SPEC"], [2022, 2031, "PER"], [2062, 2075, "LOC"], [2085, 2091, "PER"], [2145, 2153, "PER"], [2230, 2236, "PER"], [2265, 2270, "PER"], [2361, 2371, "SHIP"], [2383, 2392, "PER"], [2395, 2404, "PER"], [2698, 2706, "PER"], [2826, 2832, "PER"], [2864, 2871, "PER"], [2950, 2960, "PER"], [3039, 3047, "PER"], [3099, 3105, "SPEC"], [3116, 3125, "PER"], [3170, 3175, "PER"], [3198, 3203, "PER"], [3223, 3229, "SPEC"], [3236, 3244, "SPEC"], [3254, 3262, "SPEC"], [3265, 3274, "PER"], [3458, 3466, "PER"], [3517, 3524, "SPEC"], [3526, 3533, "SPEC"], [3653, 3660, "SPEC"], [3708, 3715, "SPEC"], [3815, 3821, "SPEC"], [3718, 3727, "PER"], [3944, 3950, "PER"], [4095, 4102, "PER"], [4109, 4114, "PER"], [4241, 4252, "PER"], [4327, 4334, "PER"], [4391, 4418, "LOC"], [4750, 4755, "PER"], [4757, 4768, "PER"], [4881, 4886, "PER"], [5036, 5041, "SPEC"], [5214, 5219, "SPEC"]]}

As I rest inside the node and interface with the link, I sense immediate confusion; the claustrophobic thought has captured the attention of the five other drones. They look at me, and I hear their voices mingling as one.\n <Is a sixth interlink node problematic on this vessel?>\n <No, it is nothing,> I assure them. <It was just an observational difference, not something to be alerted about.>\n The other drones seem to process my comment slowly. Their confusion compounds as they analyze my thoughts. I try to change the subject.\n <What is my new designation?> I ask.\n Their melded voices fill my mind. <You’re designation as Third of Five has been terminated. A new designation will be assigned to you once we reach the nearest Mega Hexahedron.> They pause briefly as they analyze my recent memories. <You have already claimed another designation. An identification provided by Species 5618?>\n <Hugh>. I stumble across the name as I think it. <I am Hugh.>\n <We are Borg,> they say boldly.\n <Yes, we are Borg,> I agree. <But I am Hugh.>\n More analysis hits my mind. Just days ago I would have given anything to share my thoughts with the Collective once again. But this felt more like an interrogation. These thoughts and memories were mine. They should not be shared.\n <This drone is malfunctioning,> the drones say. <Sensors indicate new components embedded in the drone’s body, as well as recent biological repair.>\n <Yes,> I reply. <Beverly saved my life.>", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[14, 25, "PER"], [82, 88, "PER"], [332, 338, "PER"], [519, 527, "PER"], [646, 652, "PER"], [722, 726, "PER"], [803, 809, "PER"], [942, 946, "SPEC"], [997, 1003, "PER"], [1168, 1178, "ORG"], [1496, 1506, "ORG"], [1568, 1572, "SPEC"], [1926, 1932, "PER"], [1998, 2011, "PER"], [2018, 2022, "PER"], [2186, 2192, "PER"], [3198, 3211, "PER"], [2199, 2215, "LOC"], [3301, 3316, "LOC"], [3451, 3463, "SPEC"], [3468, 3472, "PER"], [3522, 3526, "PER"], [3538, 3542, "SPEC"], [3576, 3580, "SPEC"], [3602, 3606, "PER"], [3710, 3720, "ORG"], [4009, 4016, "PER"]]}
{"id": 640, "text": "<Irrelevant. You will be reabsorbed.>\n <I do not want to be reabsorbed,> I state. My words are reminiscent of Beverly’s when she had explained that she did not want to be assimilated.\n <Irrelevant. Resistance is futile.>\n <No,> I boldly say. <Resistance is not futile.>\n My statement causes the other drones to falter, forcing them to reach out to the Collective for help. And that is when I feel the massive consciousness focus on me, analyzing my resistant thoughts. Why do they center their attention on me? I am but one drone on a small vessel. There are other drones elsewhere in other systems assimilating other species even now. Surely I am not more important than they.\n I access their thoughts and discover that this has never happened before. There has never been resistance within the Collective. Even Locutus did not resist. But I am Hugh, and I told Captain Picard that I would try to remember that fact.\n <Captain Picard,> the Collective says as it reads my thoughts. <You have had contact with Locutus.>\n <Yes.>\n <Even he told you resistance is futile.>\n <Resistance is not futile,> I reply, thinking of my conversation with the dark-skinned female on the Enterprise who came to me while I was confined behind a force field. I never did learn her identification. <Some have escaped.>\n <Irrelevant. They will be found. All will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.>\n They continue to analyze my thoughts and memories being with the humans’ ship.\n At last, the Collective says, <You have malfunctioned. Species 5618 has corrupted your processing. Your components will be reabsorbed and distributed to maturation chambers aboard the Mega Hexahedron approaching your current trajectory.>\n <I do not wish to be terminated,> I reply. Emotion is a biologically based symptom of individuality. My mind is being forced to assimilate them, and the current feeling I’m experiencing is unpleasant. It is the same emotion I’ve witnessed on the faces of every individual of every species I have previously brought into the Collective. Fear, they call it.\n I hear the Collective address the other five drones surrounding me. I hear them issue the command to terminate me, to remove my components, separate the machine from the biological, and to discard my body into space.\n Without a second thought, the five drones step away from their nodes and approach me slowly, mechanical arms whizzing up, preparing to dismantle my components.\n And the emotion I had previously felt and defined as fear was but a minuscule definition of what I felt now. Terror. Terror filled my mind. Odd how an emotion can invade a mind, dashing away thought so easily. How… “human” of me.\n Still, they circle me, and had I the capacity to think of escape options, I would react logically to the situation. But all I feel is a deep, dark terror.\n  \n ***\n Their buzzing instruments are dangerously close, and without realizing what I am doing, I push my terror out across the link. The surrounding drones instantly recoil, staring at me with haunted eyes as they stumble away from me.\n Of all the weapons the hundreds of species the Collective has come in contact with, of all the weapons that have been used against us, nothing has ever caused this kind of response. Confusion replaces the terror the five drones had just experienced, and I see them reach once again to the Collective for help.\n <Terminate him,> the Collective responds.\n The drones hesitate, looking at me with… fear?\n Ship sensors begin to sound. A simple tap into them tells me that we are approaching the larger Borg cube. I can sense the hundreds of minds on the massive cube.\n The Collective again addresses the five other drones cowering before me. <You will bring this drone aboard the Mega Hexahedron. There, the drones are prepared to reabsorb the one formerly known as Third of Five.>\n I feel the ship slow down the rest of the way as the Mega Hexahedron pulls us in with a tractor beam. Before we can even dock, I feel myself beginning to dematerialize. The other five drones are also phasing out.\n I rematerialize inside a vast opening full of cylinders that vary in size. An eerie green light barely illuminates off the black walls. The other drones from the Minor Hexahedron are standing with me.\n <We are in this ship’s maturation chamber,> I say.\n The other drones look at me. In one voice they respond mentally. <Why have they sent all of us here?>", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[110, 119, "PER"], [352, 362, "ORG"], [796, 806, "ORG"], [813, 820, "PER"], [846, 850, "PER"], [863, 877, "PER"], [920, 934, "PER"], [941, 951, "ORG"], [1009, 1016, "PER"], [1171, 1181, "SHIP"], [1475, 1485, "ORG"], [1517, 1529, "SPEC"], [1646, 1661, "LOC"], [2025, 2035, "ORG"], [2069, 2079, "ORG"], [3109, 3119, "ORG"], [3351, 3361, "ORG"], [3394, 3404, "ORG"], [3560, 3564, "SPEC"], [3631, 3641, "ORG"], [3738, 3753, "LOC"], [3824, 3837, "PER"], [3894, 3909, "LOC"], [4217, 4233, "LOC"]]}
{"id": 641, "text": "<I do not know,> I reply.\n Suddenly, the chamber erupts with the sound of many Borg drones, and I watch as the spaces between cylinders containing the young species we have captured get crowded. The mechanical sounds emanating from the group bounce off the black walls, making it difficult to think. I panic, and so do the drones next to me.\n Thousands of voices speak at us at the same time. <We have come to reabsorb your components into the most recently assimilated children of a species recently caught.> The thought is not directed at me alone, but the five other drones with me.\n <But we are Borg, and we have not been modified,> they argue.\n There is no hesitation from the Collective. <Your thoughts have been contaminated by the one who has been modified. Your thoughts and memories are dangerous. You must be reabsorbed now.>\n There are easily a hundred drones converging on us, perhaps more. I detect fear emanating from the five drones and realize that this time, each of them are experiencing what I had on the Minor Hexahedron. The emotion is coming from all of us individually. All five look to me for guidance; they know as well as I do that the Collective has abandoned them. So I tell them to do exactly as I had done when they attacked me.\n <Flood the Collective with your fearful emotions. It is the only way to survive.>\n The massive surge of emotion shakes me to my core. Indeed, the hundreds of drones speeding toward us stop abruptly, shrinking back, looking around them as if the ship were going to crush. Audible screams echo through the maturation chamber as the young drones, who were not fully used to the Collective, feel fear once again.\n I feel the Collective flinch at the emotion. The thousand voices are silent, but only for a moment.\n <This vessel has been compromised,> the Collective says. I cannot help but detect malice in the voice, but I am likely seeing emotion where it does not exist. <Uplinks to the Collective will be severed momentarily.>\n And then it happens. No goodbye, like the ones Geordi or Captain Picard gave me. No direction or guidance. Just complete and utter silence. The Collective is gone, and hundreds of drones surrounding me on this ship are lost.\n ***\n Hundreds of individuals, no longer drones of a Collective Conscious… All of them exiled, left to their own devices. How can I help them? They look at one another, seeking guidance. Seeking purpose. They get none.\n What can I offer them?\n One of the Borg standing next to me — one who had been with me on the Minor Hexahedron — stares at me expectantly.\n “We are Borg,” he says audibly. It is strange to hear another Borg speak. One voice is quiet. “But there are no other voices. They are gone.”\n I look at the exile. “Yes. What you are saying is that you are lonely.” I look around the chamber and see that, even with hundreds of exiles standing together, they are all completely alone. I know that feeling. Beverly had first said it, but the woman with dark skin had defined it. I never did learn her designation.\n Designation. A name.\n I look back at the Borg standing next to me and say, “You require a new designation. A name to distinguish you from the others.”\n He looks at me in confusion. “My designation is Second of Five.”\n “There are several Seconds of Fives on this vessel,” I reply. “You need a new designation to distinguish yourself from the others.”\n He tilts his head, processing my request. “This request is acceptable. What is my new designation?”\n I do not know. Geordi and Beverly had given me the name Hugh. This exile waits expectantly for me to assign him a name. Should I do so?\n I pause. I do not understand the origin of names, but I understand their purpose. I immediately create one, and say, “Your name is Lentah.”\n He processes the name, accepting it easily, just as I had done with Geordi.\n “We are Lentah.”\n I put my hand on my chest and say, “I am Hugh.” I point back to him and say, “You are Lentah.”\n “You are Hugh,” he echoes. “We are Lentah.”\n How many cycles had it taken me to learn to speak in terms of “I” and “me?” Even now, I do not fully understand or comprehend my own individuality.\n But the renaming of the exiles could be problematic. The name Lentah could very well be assigned to every exile on the ship through our own local link on the ship, especially if this drone continues to say “We are Lentah” instead of “I am Lentah.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[79, 83, "SPEC"], [599, 603, "SPEC"], [682, 692, "ORG"], [1025, 1041, "LOC"], [1163, 1173, "ORG"], [1272, 1282, "ORG"], [1636, 1646, "ORG"], [1682, 1692, "ORG"], [1812, 1822, "ORG"], [1947, 1957, "ORG"], [2036, 2042, "PER"], [2046, 2060, "PER"], [2133, 2143, "ORG"], [2267, 2287, "ORG"], [2469, 2473, "SPEC"], [2528, 2544, "LOC"], [2582, 2586, "SPEC"], [2636, 2640, "SPEC"], [2929, 2936, "PER"], [3078, 3082, "SPEC"], [3237, 3251, "PER"], [3274, 3290, "PER"], [3504, 3510, "PER"], [3515, 3522, "PER"], [3545, 3549, "PER"], [3757, 3763, "PER"], [3835, 3841, "PER"], [3852, 3858, "PER"], [3903, 3907, "PER"], [3948, 3954, "PER"], [3967, 3971, "PER"], [3993, 3999, "PER"], [4214, 4220, "PER"], [4366, 4372, "PER"], [4391, 4397, "PER"]]}
