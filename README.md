Code
- entity_recognizers/entity_recognizer.py (the actual model and most of its supporting code)
- cosi217 
- hw3utils.py

Data files
- annotated_files/annotated_data.jsonl (training & dev annotated corpus)
- annotated_files/fics_annotated_all.jsonl (annotated test corpus)
- dataset.zip (the full dataset containing complete star trek episodes, used to train word2vec model)

Other
- get_word2vec.py (unfortunately, in order to train the model in entity_recognizer.py, you need to generate a file called trek_w2v.model, which was too large to upload here)
