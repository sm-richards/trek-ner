While on a routine patrol mission to Outpost 7, Enterprise has received a distress signal from a Federation colony located on planet M64 in Sector 13. Enterprise is the nearest ship in this sector and as such we have responded to the call. The delay should, at most, be no more than a few hours.” Captain James Kirk completed the recording, hitting the button on the arm of his command chair and settling back. “Mister Spock,” he said, turning toward the science station, “What information do we have regarding M64 and the colony there?”\n Spock swiveled his chair to face the captain. “All Federation scans to this point have revealed the planet to be uninhabited with the exception of lower animal life forms and for the most part, it is highly vegetated and has a stable, temperate climate. A Federation colony was begun there approximately one year ago to study the indigenous plant and animal life. Most recent contact with the colony was six months ago, at which time there were no reported problems.”\n “So whatever happened there probably happened very suddenly and recently,” Kirk surmised.\n “That is a possibility, Captain,” Spock replied, “However, I would hesitate to make such presumptions without additional information. Six months is a long enough period of time for any number of things to have happened.”\n “Klingons?”\n “Possible, but not probable. This is far afield of their usual sphere of influence. Even Romulan intervention, though more probable, would likely not explain the situation.”\n Kirk nodded slightly and turned toward the communications station. “Lieutenant Uhura, play back the distress call.”\n “Aye, sir,” she responded. Her slender fingers played lightly over the keys and within seconds a nearly hysterical voice sounded over the bridge com.\n “This is Commander Martin of the M64 colony. If anyone can hear this, please – please help us! We can’t get away – most of our people are dead already! They mean to kill us all!  You must help us!” The message lapsed into static.\n “It’s a recording, Captain,” Uhura volunteered. There is no way of determining how long ago it was made. I have continued to monitor and there have been no new messages.”\n Kirk nodded in acknowledgement. Who was “they,” he thought.\n “Captain,” Spock announced, “We are approaching the planet.”\n “Thank you, Mister Spock. Engage forward view screen.” A blue-green planet with a hazy cloud cover shimmered in the distance and slowly filled the screen. “Standard orbit, Mister Sulu.”\n “Aye, sir. Plotted and laid in.” Lieutenant Commander Sulu set the coordinates with practiced precision.\n “Spock,” Kirk said, rising from the command chair, “ I want you to head up a landing party to the surface. We’re going to find out what happened down there.” Spock stood to face him, hands folded loosely behind his back. Kirk continued. “Take a three-man security team, a medical officer of McCoy’s choice, and that new transfer from Yorktown…” he hesitated, “What’s her name?”\n Spock stiffened imperceptibly. “Lieutenant Gaines.”\n “Right.” Kirk turned to Uhura. “Relay the coordinates of the distress signal to the transporter room and have Lieutenant Gaines and the security team meet us there.”\n “Aye, sir.”\n “And tell McCoy I need one of his officers for a landing party in 5 minutes in the transporter room.”\n Uhura nodded and began making the calls as Kirk moved toward the turbolift, his first officer following.\n —————–\n Transporter room one bustled with activity as the landing party assembled and checked their gear. The door hissed open to admit Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock, and the crew came to quiet attention.\n “Dr. Wilson,” Kirk addressed the young, dark-haired man who stood before him. “Dr. McCoy tells me that you can handle just about anything that comes up.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[431, 441, "SHIP"], [420, 429, "LOC"], [480, 490, "ORG"], [509, 519, "LOC"], [523, 532, "LOC"], [534, 544, "SHIP"], [680, 698, "PER"], [795, 807, "PER"], [894, 897, "LOC"], [922, 927, "PER"], [973, 983, "GPE"], [1178, 1188, "GPE"], [1506, 1513, "PER"], [1516, 1521, "PER"], [1466, 1470, "PER"], [1705, 1713, "SPEC"], [1806, 1813, "SPEC"], [1892, 1896, "PER"], [1960, 1976, "PER"], [2169, 2185, "PER"], [2193, 2203, "LOC"], [2410, 2417, "PER"], [2563, 2567, "PER"], [2625, 2632, "PER"], [2635, 2640, "PER"], [2698, 2710, "PER"], [2858, 2869, "PER"], [2906, 2931, "PER"], [2980, 2985, "PER"], [2988, 2992, "PER"], [3137, 3142, "PER"], [3200, 3204, "PER"], [3270, 3275, "PER"], [3390, 3407, "PER"], [3435, 3440, "PER"], [3420, 3424, "PER"], [3521, 3538, "PER"], [3313, 3321, "SHIP"], [3601, 3606, "PER"], [3694, 3699, "PER"], [3737, 3741, "PER"], [3808, 3828, "LOC"], [3936, 3948, "PER"], [3953, 3972, "PER"], [4014, 4024, "PER"], [4027, 4031, "PER"], [4092, 4101, "PER"]]}
{"id": 922, "text": "The youthful doctor nodded. “Yes sir. I specialized in combat medicine.”\n “Good. We don’t know what to expect down there.” The captain stopped, taking in the landing crew. “As for the rest of you, be on the alert for anything. The colonists were not specific with their message; all we know is that a life-threatening situation exists where six months ago there was none. Mister Spock is in command and can fill you in on any necessary details.” He paused again, scanning their faces. Good crew, he thought. He turned to his first officer. “Mister Spock, keep us posted. McCoy is standing by in sickbay to receive survivors, but use discretion; if there is any trouble I want you out of there – understood?”\n “Understood, Captain.” Spock motioned to his small crew to take their positions on the transporter pads. Lieutenant Phyllida Gaines, standing on the pad nearest Spock, flashed him a smile, which he chose to ignore.\n “Nice to see you again, Mister Spock,” she whispered.\n “Energize,” came the Vulcan’s command.\n —————-\n The landing party materialized inside a small room that seemed more than anything like the aftermath of a tornado. Assorted crates and machinery lay scattered about amid rubble from a ceiling that seemingly threatened to fall at any moment. Though signs of struggle were evident, there were no inhabitants and no bodies to be seen. In the corner, Spock’s tricorder registered the presence of a small terminal buried beneath the rubble; its insistent flashing indicated a message was still being sent. He switched it off.\n Spock glanced around the room, taking in the eerie silence, and addressed the crew. “We will separate into groups of two and scout the colony area, taking complete tricorder readings. Ensign Davis,” he indicated one of the security men, “You team up with Doctor Wilson. DuPuy and Echols, you make another team. Lieutenant Gaines, you are with me. Keep your communicator frequencies open and report anything the least bit unusual; we will meet back here in half an hour.” A chorus of acknowledgements followed as the crew spread out and began their search.\n ——————\n Kirk had not been back on the bridge for more than 20 minutes when Chekov reported from the science station that a large ion storm was approaching.\n “ETA, Mister Chekov?”\n “I vould estimate 2 hours at its present course and speed, Keptin.”\n That doesn’t give Spock much time, Kirk thought. “Very well, Lieutenant. Maintain surveillance of the storm and let me know of any change.”\n “Aye, Sir.”\n —————–\n On the surface, Spock and his party had turned up nothing remarkable except one small detail. Despite a search of the immediate area surrounding the beam-down point, there were no bodies; no trace of the colony could be found apart from the abandoned and ruined instruments. Checking his tricorder readings yet again, Spock moved toward the doctor. “Dr. Wilson, you can locate no disease-producing organisms? Anything that can account for our findings?”\n The young doctor looked at him with puzzled eyes. “No, Commander. It’s strange, too, that they should just disappear like this. I really am at a loss to explain it. If I could just find some physical remains I might be able to determine a cause.”\n “Yes – fascinating. Carry on, Doctor.”\n “Yes, Mister Spock.”\n In answer to the beep that had just sounded, Spock flipped open his communicator. “Spock here.”\n “Spock,” came Kirk’s voice, “We have a large ion storm on our scanners moving rapidly in this direction. Don’t stay down there any longer than you have to. ETA is 2 hours.” There was a pause. “Revise that ETA to 90 minutes, Mister Spock. That storm is really bearing down on us. I want you up here within 40 minutes.”\n “Acknowledged, Captain. I shall take the necessary precautions. Spock out.” He strode quickly toward the others. “I have just been informed of an ion storm heading this way. Please continue your research as efficiently and quickly as possible. Meet back here in half an hour.” The crew acknowledged and once again split into their assigned groups to finish gathering data.\n Phyllida Gaines stood a few feet away with her back to him, taking tricorder readings. Her golden hair cascaded around her shoulders in an almost non-regulation style. Two years had passed since the incident on Mevinna; years during which Spock had set aside all memory of the lovely lieutenant and their unusual escape from the Andorian force field. But, with her transfer to Enterprise, memories began again to crowd in upon him; her winsome smile pervaded his thoughts unmercifully and he could still feel her warm lips on his own from the remembered kiss. “I am your destiny,” she had said. Illogical. Drawing himself up, the unwanted thoughts and rousing emotions were thrust aside with stern Vulcan discipline and the welcome and familiar non-emotion settled upon him like a shield.\n “Lieutenant Gaines.”\n She turned. “Sir?” The mischief dancing in those blue eyes was apparent even without a smile.\n Spock cleared his throat. “What are your findings in correlation with the possibility of a technical breakdown and/or cause of such within the colony itself?\n “Well, certain technological functions -have ceased. The exact date of which I can’t be certain, except that it was fairly recent. Some systems appear to have merely stopped due to lack of maintenance, others have apparently been sabotaged. Whether by the colonists themselves in an unstable emotional state or by some outside force, it is impossible to tell. However, I did find some unusual markings over here…” He followed her inside a nearby building that had apparently been a laboratory for the colonists. “See, here; on this piece of machinery.” She pointed out a large dent in the side of the main computer console. Inside and around the indentation were several sets of parallel scratch marks as though made by giant hands.\n “Fascinating…”\n By the time Spock and Gaines heard the cries it was already too late. On reaching the point where DuPuy and Echols had been scouting, they found very little left of the men. They met Doctor Wilson running to the scene from the opposite direction. Spock’s tricorder was out in an instant, as was the doctor’s.\n “How horrible!”  Phyllida gasped at the sight of the badly burned and decomposed bodies.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[127, 134, "PER"], [372, 384, "PER"], [541, 553, "PER"], [571, 576, "PER"], [722, 729, "PER"], [814, 840, "PER"], [732, 737, "PER"], [870, 875, "PER"], [949, 961, "PER"], [1001, 1007, "SPEC"], [1375, 1380, "PER"], [1550, 1555, "PER"], [1734, 1746, "PER"], [1805, 1818, "PER"], [1820, 1825, "PER"], [1830, 1836, "PER"], [1861, 1878, "PER"], [2115, 2119, "PER"], [2182, 2188, "PER"], [2270, 2283, "PER"], [2346, 2352, "PER"], [2374, 2379, "PER"], [2391, 2395, "PER"], [2417, 2427, "PER"], [2534, 2539, "PER"], [3028, 3037, "PER"], [3251, 3257, "PER"], [3267, 3279, "PER"], [3366, 3371, "PER"], [3381, 3386, "PER"], [3394, 3398, "PER"], [3328, 3333, "PER"], [3604, 3616, "PER"], [3714, 3721, "PER"], [3763, 3768, "PER"], [4073, 4088, "PER"], [4284, 4291, "LOC"], [4312, 4317, "PER"], [4450, 4460, "SHIP"], [4402, 4410, "SPEC"], [4771, 4777, "SPEC"], [4864, 4881, "PER"], [4980, 4985, "PER"], [5901, 5906, "PER"], [5911, 5917, "PER"], [5987, 5992, "PER"], [5997, 6003, "PER"], [6072, 6085, "PER"], [6136, 6141, "PER"], [6216, 6224, "PER"], [6188, 6194, "PER"], [2836, 2841, "PER"], [2868, 2878, "PER"]]}
{"id": 923, "text": "Spock was down on one knee, scanning the strange looking plants on which one of the bodies lay. “Apparently these plants produce a type of fast-acting acid, making their prey easier to digest,” he commented. “It looks as though those vines…Doctor!”\n The doctor turned from the body he was examining in time to see the vine come up to encircle his neck. He let out a strangled cry as Spock quickly fired on the plant with his phaser, destroying it instantly. Gaines lowered Wilson gently to the grass.\n “Too late…” she said softly, “Too late.”\n Spock knelt to examine the wound around the doctor’s neck. “The acid appears to be even faster acting than I had thought. See, where the tissue and vessels have been completely dissolved.” He rose, taking Gaines by the arm. “Come, we must avoid the slightest contact with these plants.”\n “We can’t just leave him here!”\n “That is an order, Lieutenant. Let’s go now!” She acquiesced reluctantly to the pressure on her arm, but her gaze remained fixed on Wilson’s body as they quickly left the area. On the move, Spock opened his communicator and signaled to Ensign Davis, who had been scouting with Doctor Wilson. “Ensign Davis, respond.”\n “Here, Mister Spock,” came the reply.\n “Ensign, return to the beam-down point promptly. Stay clear of the forest and be on your guard for creeping vines that we have determined to be deadly.”\n “Aye, Sir. On my way. Davis out.”\n Spock and Gaines had nearly reached the beam-down point when Spock’s communicator signaled. “Spock here.”\n “Spock,” came Kirk’s urgent voice, “You and your party must come up at once. The storm is advancing much more rapidly.”\n “Yes, Sir.” Although Spock was reluctant to leave when he was so close to finding a solution to the disappearance of the colony, he knew that with the loss of half of his crew and the advancing storm nothing more could be accomplished at this time. “We’ll be ready within 5 minutes. Spock out.” He changed frequencies on his communicator and signaled to Ensign Davis, who still had not returned. “Ensign Davis, return to the beam-down point.” Silence. “Ensign Davis, respond!”\n Phyllida’s brows drew together as she cast a worried look at Spock. “What if he can’t respond?” She pulled out her tricorder and started scanning in Davis’ last known direction.\n Spock answered by calling Enterprise. “Captain, one of my team is missing and is not responding. We have to find him before we beam out.”\n “Spock, you’re out of time.”\n “Just a few more minutes, Captain.” He looked at Lieutenant Gaines, who looked up from her tricorder and shook her head.\n “No life signs that I can find. I don’t think he made it.”\n “Spock,” Kirk was fairly shouting, “You don’t HAVE a few minutes! Stand by to beam up at my sig………..no for an ans………..”\n “Captain? Captain!” The only reply was static.\n CHAPTER TWO – CAPTIVES\n “Scotty, get them up here!”  The yellow alert signal flashed insistently.\n “I’m tryin’, Captain. The storm…” Lieutenant Montgomery Scott manipulated the controls as only he could.\n Kirk looked toward the transporter as two shimmering figures began to materialize, and then were gone.\n “What happened, Scott?”\n “It’s the storm. It’s already interferin’ with the transporter. We canna lock onto them, and if I try again, we’ll lose ‘em for sure!”\n Kirk struck the console with his fist. There was nothing they could do now but wait out the storm. Who knew what kind of situation they could be in down there…?\n —————-\n “Mister Spock! The storm…The transporter couldn’t lock onto our signal. That means…”\n “That means we’re stranded, for the time being, Lieutenant.” Spock took a step away and gauged their surroundings. To the south, west and north of the small clearing in which they stood, nothing but dense forest growth could be seen, mingled with the small structures of the colony. In his estimation, the proximity of the plants made the buildings unsafe to stay in for any length of time. To the east the clearing extended with less growth to a small hill some 1,000 meters away. The sky, dotted with clouds, was a deep blue, getting deeper as evening approached.\n Spock heard a faint rustling from the shadows behind them and turned to see tendrils creeping slowly toward them from the undergrowth.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 5, "PER"], [240, 246, "PER"], [383, 388, "PER"], [458, 464, "PER"], [473, 479, "PER"], [544, 549, "PER"], [749, 755, "PER"], [884, 894, "PER"], [1055, 1060, "PER"], [1101, 1113, "PER"], [1142, 1155, "PER"], [1158, 1170, "PER"], [1190, 1202, "PER"], [1223, 1229, "PER"], [1398, 1403, "PER"], [1472, 1477, "PER"], [1411, 1416, "PER"], [1421, 1427, "PER"], [1504, 1509, "PER"], [1519, 1524, "PER"], [1532, 1536, "PER"], [1660, 1665, "PER"], [1922, 1927, "PER"], [1993, 2005, "PER"], [2036, 2048, "PER"], [2092, 2104, "PER"], [2117, 2125, "PER"], [2178, 2183, "PER"], [2266, 2271, "PER"], [2296, 2301, "PER"], [2322, 2332, "PER"], [2335, 2342, "PER"], [2436, 2441, "PER"], [2491, 2498, "PER"], [2514, 2531, "PER"], [2648, 2653, "PER"], [2656, 2660, "PER"], [2769, 2776, "PER"], [2778, 2785, "PER"], [2928, 2935, "PER"], [2841, 2847, "PER"], [2949, 2976, "PER"], [3021, 3025, "PER"], [3141, 3146, "PER"], [3286, 3290, "PER"], [3457, 3469, "PER"], [3603, 3608, "PER"], [4109, 4114, "PER"]]}

Tired of dealing with the constant threats to the well-being of the crew, and tired of filling out the endless death certificates. The last such “adventure” had claimed a total of twelve crewmen. Twelve young lives lost in the name of exploration, McCoy thought.\n  \n Of those lost, two crewmen were taken quickly by an allergic reaction to the native flora of the planet. A ship that can take men across the galaxy protected by shields and photon torpedoes, and we still can’t save someone from acute anaphylactic shock, McCoy thought to himself.\n Shortly after beaming down to the surface of Rynair II the men accidently inhaled a bit of pollen that proved fatal. The only saving grace of the situation was that the pollen only affected an individual who was also allergic to Elonian zongs, which McCoy noted in his log were roughly the equivalent to an Earth coconut. Thinking of this, McCoy shuddered slightly realizing how easily the ship could have been without three members of the senior crew, as Jim, Spock and himself had beamed down along with the landing party. Probably not Spock, McCoy thought, those damned Vulcan bodily functions probably have a back-up measure even for anaphylaxis.\n McCoy knew and accepted death as something which every doctor deals with from time to time, but he was unnerved that these sort-of situations seemed to be the norm at this point in his life. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, he told himself. As much as he enjoyed his friendship with Jim and his whatever-you-might-call-it with Spock, McCoy never had felt at home in space.\n One thing that had always reminded McCoy of home was a good drink. As a proud “Son of the South”, it was almost bred into him. At the moment, he felt like a drink might be the best friend he had. Grabbing a bottle from his shelf and taking a seat behind his desk in sickbay, McCoy poured himself some Saurian brandy. He sipped the strong liquor, attempting to relax and allowing his mind to drift back to a time in his life before Starfleet. Back then, his drink of choice was a Mint Julep, but he felt like the replicators onboard the Enterprisecould never get them quite right. Maybe it’s because the temperature is always 72 degrees in here, with simulated sunlight, McCoy thought in a matter-of-fact sense. A Mint Julep is meant to be enjoyed on a hot summer evening. Evening—even that has no meaning in space. McCoy sighed and poured another glass.\n – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n Growing up inGeorgia, young Leonard Horatio McCoy always pictured himself as going to medical school, settling down with a beautiful belle, and living the life of an “old country doctor.” But, for whatever reason, he only got two of those three goals checked off his list. His wife Jocelyn was everything he had hoped for since the first time they met back at that high school dance. But after their daughter Joanna was born, it seemed to him that Jocelyn changed overnight. He never had evidence of her cheating on him, but every time he looked at Joanna the thought would arise.\n  Is she really my daughter? He would ponder as he looked down into his daughter’s crib. Does it matter?\n “Leonard! Leonard! Where are you?”\n “Out here on the back porch Jocelyn!” McCoy replied, while sipping a Mint Julip and watching the sun set on another August day.\n “We have to talk.” Jocelyn said as she finally found her husband. “I think we both know that this isn’t working anymore. I was fine staying at home being the ‘Doctor’s Wife’ but now I feel like I’m the ‘Parent of the Doctor’s Daughter’.”\n “What do you mean Jocelyn?” McCoy said, while feeling more than a little blindsided.\n “What I mean is that you go and sit in your clinic everyday and help people, and I’m stuck here raising our daughter by myself. Sometimes I think that you care more about your patients than your own wife and daughter!” she exclaimed with the force of months of suppressed thoughts.\n “Dammit Jocelyn! I’m a doctor, not a daycare provider! I spent years going through medical school to help these people and this is the thanks I get?” He angrily replied.\n “Well I went through eight and a half months of pregnancy, concluding with delivery of our child and this is the life I get? A husband that is out of the door before sunrise, and with drink in his hand at every sunset? I could have gone to school too, in California, but I chose you.”\n “Well I guess you have another choice to make.” He said, turning his attention back to the sunset.\n “I’ve already made it. You should be hearing from my lawyer in the next few days. Until then, Joanna and I will be staying with my sister.” Jocelyn sternly replied at her husband who was still refusing to look at her.\n “Why don’t you go ahead and stay at Clay’s house. I’m sure he’d be glad to have you.” McCoy said as he closed his eyes. He knew he had gone too far and regretted it instantly.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[32, 41, "PER"], [107, 120, "PER"], [380, 385, "PER"], [653, 658, "PER"], [725, 734, "SHIP"], [930, 935, "PER"], [987, 992, "LOC"], [1020, 1025, "PER"], [1136, 1139, "PER"], [1141, 1146, "PER"], [1218, 1223, "PER"], [1225, 1230, "PER"], [1253, 1259, "SPEC"], [1332, 1337, "PER"], [1617, 1620, "PER"], [1661, 1666, "PER"], [1668, 1673, "PER"], [1743, 1748, "PER"], [1983, 1988, "PER"], [2009, 2016, "SPEC"], [2139, 2148, "ORG"], [2244, 2254, "SHIP"], [2378, 2383, "PER"], [2523, 2528, "PER"], [2657, 2664, "LOC"], [2672, 2693, "PER"], [2926, 2933, "PER"], [3053, 3059, "PER"], [3092, 3099, "PER"], [3193, 3199, "PER"], [3332, 3339, "PER"], [3341, 3348, "PER"], [3395, 3402, "PER"], [3405, 3410, "PER"], [3753, 3760, "PER"], [3763, 3768, "PER"], [4105, 4111, "PER"], [4755, 4761, "PER"], [4801, 4808, "PER"], [4916, 4920, "PER"], [4966, 4971, "PER"]]}
{"id": 925, "text": "“Unbelievable!” She screamed. “I’ve told you before that things between him and I ended a long time ago. Due in large part to you, I might add. Leonard, I was always faithful to you, even though you’ll never be half the father that Clay might have been for Joanna.”\n With that, Jocelyn McCoy walked back into the house; the house that Leonard realized would soon be hers along with most all of Leonard’s money and possessions. He wondered if he’d be lucky enough that she didn’t take the bones from his body. McCoy sighed and made himself another drink. \n CHAPTER 2\n …Sweet home Alabama! Lord I’m coming home to you!….That was one from way-way back in the 20th Century folks, but still a great way to start your morning! We’ve got 10 in a row headed your way next!…\n “Hmmmmrph!” Leonard slowly sat up in bed and told himself that he was getting too old for this routine. Without even opening his eyes he could sense a hungry grandchild standing next to his bed wearing the devilish grin of someone who had just turned on her grandfather’s radio to get his attention.\n “Yes darlin’?” Leonard asked her. His drawl was always more pronounced before having his morning coffee.\n “Grandpa, can we go to the zoo today?” The little girl asked as she pulled on his comforter.\n “Perhaps dear, but first we’ll need to ask Grandma. We both know that she’s the one that calls the shots.”  McCoy stretched, slipped on his house shoes and pulled on a robe. He reached to his nightstand and grabbed his PADD to open up the day’s newspaper–Outbreak on Vulcan Outpost: Federation Seeks Help of Medical Community–the main headline read. Makes sense, thought McCoy, pointy-eared logic lovers can’t even display enough emotion to ask for help themselves.\n McCoy punched in the code for coffee on his replicator as he continued reading. Damn fake coffee. Joanna had bought him and Jocelyn the replicator for their anniversary last year and he had finally started using it—but not before he passionately explained to Jocelyn that part of the charm of coffee is its simplicity. If it was good enough for the settlers of this land so many generations ago, then it didn’t need to be upgraded.\n McCoy continued reading–…in light of the Organian medical and peace conference being held in conjunction with the Klingons, all essential Starfleet Medical personnel are unable to assist with this emergency. The Federation hopes that some of the more experienced physicians and nurses from Earth and Andoria will volunteer to assist in this urgent matter. Because the outbreak seems to only affect Vulcan individuals, it has been determined to be too great a risk to seek assistance from the Vulcan Medical Academy. For those interested in volunteering locally, shuttles will be leaving from the Atlanta Shipyards at 1200 hours today.\n “Grandma said we can go! Grandma said we can go!” Lucy yelled as she ran back into the kitchen. “Can we leave soon?”\n “Sure little lady, but first Grandpa has to get ready. And so do you…unless you plan on showing off your pajamas to the elephants.” Leonard walked back towards his bedroom and found his wife getting ready for the day. He set his PADD down on her dresser and stood behind her as she looked in the mirror.\n “Good morning Mrs. McCoy…” He said, trying to goad a response.\n “Good morning to you, too, Dr. McCoy.” She responded.\n “That’s only Monday through Friday. It’s the weekend and I’m as much a Mr. as I choose to be.”\n “Well today it sounds like you’re a Grandpa, and I’m sure you’ll treat Lucy with just as much care as you would a patient.”\n “Still bringing that up…” McCoy said with a grin. It had been twenty five years since his marriage had almost fallen apart. He was close to joining Starfleet back then, just to get away from the mess of his divorce. Medicine On The Cutting Edge – Practicing in Space the advertisement had read. He had been to space once before as an observer shortly after graduating from Ole Miss. He knew then that he wanted to be a doctor, but he was pretty sure he wanted to keep his practice local. As in on Earth, he had joked to himself.\n Instead of enlisting, he decided to cut back his office hours and make the effort to work things out with Jocelyn. It turned out that she had run back to Clay during their separation and divorce, but shortly after Jocelyn saw that Clay had not changed as much as he claimed. McCoy knew that it wouldn’t be easy–the divorce was finalized and they had to get married again–but he made a choice to use it as a fresh start and he was glad that he had. Most importantly, he was glad that Jocelyn had given him the opportunity.\n “So is this goodbye?” Jocelyn asked.\n “What are you talking about? I thought we’d both go with Lucy today.” A confused McCoy replied.\n “I’m talking about this,” Jocelyn said as she picked up his PADD and pointed to the story he had been reading. “They need help. You may not be a young buck, but you are experienced.”\n “I wouldn’t call one observation mission experience. And you know as well as I do about my aviophobia. I still try to avoid riding in a hovercar if I can. On top of that, I can’t even begin to imagine stepping onto one of those transporter pads. Last time I was lucky to not have to leave the ship. Tearing apart someone into a million little bits and then rearranging them again. It’s just not natural, Jocelyn.”  McCoy said, knowing that Jocelyn always found his excuses overblown. Sometimes he made an effort to stretch them out even more just to get under her skin.\n “Listen Leonard,” Jocelyn said with a more serious tone than McCoy had expected. “You once told me that the reason you went to school for years were to help people and make a difference. Now I know you have helped people here, but this is a chance to do something special, something important. I think you should take it.”\n McCoy paused a moment, and then said, “You know, I was going to enlist after our divorce. I had even filled out some of the preliminary forms. But I chose you and Joanna instead. I couldn’t live with running away to space instead of staying here and being a man.”\n “Well you have been a man, and a husband, and a father–”\n “Don’t forget grandfather.”\n “And grandfather. But now you need to be a doctor…and just maybe a hero.” Jocelyn had that look. The one that Leonard knew meant the conversation was over and a decision had been made.\n A hero huh? He thought. I just hope they have real coffee, because at my age I’m going to need it to keep up.\n CHAPTER 3\n McCoy arrived at the Atlanta Shipyards at 1130 hours that morning. He had packed as much as he could before Jocelyn shuffled him out the door. In a very rushed exchange, he tried to explain to Lucy that he wasn’t going to be able to go to the zoo with her and that he had to go away for a while. Hopefully not too long Lucy, for both our sakes, he had thought.

{"id": 926, "text": "“Excuse me sir, but there’s no tours today.”\n McCoy looked up to see a man in a security uniform sitting behind the main desk. This guy looks like he’s seen more buffet lines than doctors in his life, he thought.\n “Well excuse me sir, but I imagine you are constantly short of breath, have a hard time feeling motivated and constantly need some type of sugar.”\n “Uh yeah, but how’d you know that?” the guard said between grunts while attempting to sit up straight. “And what are you here for?”\n “Son, I’m Leonard H. McCoy, M.D. and I’m here for the volunteer effort. Where’s the line start?” McCoy said proudly.\n “Well, I’d say about where you’re standing.” The guard said as he smiled and looked evidently satisfied to have the last word.\n Great, McCoy thought. It looks like it’s going to be a lonely shuttle ride.\n – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n This particular transport shuttle turned out to be larger than McCoy had envisioned. Must have been expecting more volunteers, he thought. Once aboard, he was able to find a nice interior restroom with no windows. He remained there throughout takeoff and through most of the flight. Fighting back any rumblings of a panic attack, he reverted to talking in his head in order to tolerate the situation. I’m not moving, I’m just in a small room and then I’ll be in a bigger one, he tried to tell himself.\n “–This is the pilot speaking. We’ll need everyone to return to their seats as we receive clearance to dock with Enterprise.–”\n McCoy heard a knock on the restroom door and after trying and failing to explain his aviophobia to the Lieutenant, he finally stepped out of the restroom and into the cabin. He was actually surprised that it had taken so long for anyone to notice that the restroom had been continually occupied. I guess that’s what happens when you’re the only passenger, he jokingly thought. However, when he went to take a seat, he was surprised to find he was not the lone volunteer. Apparently, between McCoy locating a hiding spot in the restroom and takeoff, another passenger had come on board.\n “You wouldn’t happen to have a piece of chewing gum would you?” McCoy asked the woman as he sat down next to her and fastened his safety belt. He couldn’t help but feel that for some reason, she seemed rather familiar.\n “I’m sorry, I don’t.” She replied in a soothing voice. “Christine Chapel-Korby and you are?”\n “Dr. Leonard H. McCoy. At your service, Madame.”\n The woman laughed, “Actually, it’s the reverse, Dr McCoy.”\n At first McCoy was angered, but then he understood what she meant.\n “It looks like I will be your nurse on this rescue mission” she continued.\n “In that case, there are a few things you ought to know. First off, I’m not used to working in a sickbay with so many different species of patients.” McCoy said as he started to slip back into a more pronounced drawl. It also tended to happen when he was complaining about something.\n “So, I’ll need all the help from you that I can get. I’ve been told once or twice that my bedside manner can be a little rough. I for one, however, like to think of myself as a realist.”\n Chapel blushed. “Don’t worry Doctor,” she said with an air of care that McCoy appreciated. “I spent years in space while searching for my husband, who at that time was just my lost fiancé. I was limited to traveling aboard private ships as a nurse practitioner, but in that time, I was introduced to treating many different patients.”\n “That’s good. Probably, honest work I imagine.” He replied.\n “Believe me it was. Though it must’ve taken its toll on me, as I’ve noticed Roger hasn’t aged nearly as much as I have.” She said, more to herself than to McCoy.\n “—Attention passengers and crew: Prepare for final docking procedures—”\n The shuttle reduced its thrusters and lurched backwards slightly as it began to slow its approach to Enterprise. For the first time, McCoy allowed himself to look out of one of the window ports. Quite the vessel, he thought. Again he had the strange feeling of familiarity. I must’ve seen a starship like this in one of Lucy’s digi-books, he thought trying to explain away the sensation. He was already missing his family.\n Enterprise grew larger and larger in comparison to the window port opening as the shuttle swung around to the aft end of the starship and the shuttle bay. McCoy could feel what he assumed was the tractor beams of the ship take control as the shuttle came to a soft landing inside the bay.  The side hatch to the shuttle released its pressurization as it slowly slid open.\n “I guess this is our stop” McCoy joked to Chapel.\n The doctor and nurse stood and began to exit the shuttle. Waiting at attention just outside the shuttle door was a rather proud looking man with brown hair. McCoy, struck by his appearance,  couldn’t tell if the man reminded him of someone, or that he just looked different than most of his clinic patients.\n “Velcome aboard ze Enterprise, I am Lieutenant Commander Pavel Chekov. You must be Dr. McCoy and Nurse Chapel.”\n Don’t think he’s from Georgia. Although surprised by the gentleman’s thick accent, McCoy was relieved by the lack of a grand reception. He did, however, now find himself in the need for something to take his nerves down a notch.\n “Mr. Chekov is it–” McCoy began to ask.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[46, 51, "PER"], [505, 527, "PER"], [592, 597, "PER"], [748, 753, "PER"], [964, 969, "PER"], [1516, 1526, "SHIP"], [1531, 1536, "PER"], [1634, 1644, "PER"], [2022, 2027, "PER"], [2182, 2187, "PER"], [2394, 2416, "PER"], [2433, 2453, "PER"], [2530, 2538, "PER"], [2551, 2556, "PER"], [2836, 2841, "PER"], [3159, 3165, "PER"], [3188, 3194, "PER"], [3231, 3236, "PER"], [3632, 3637, "PER"], [3711, 3716, "PER"], [3893, 3903, "SHIP"], [3925, 3930, "PER"], [4112, 4116, "PER"], [4216, 4226, "SHIP"], [4371, 4376, "PER"], [4616, 4621, "PER"], [4631, 4637, "PER"], [4797, 4802, "PER"], [4968, 4978, "SHIP"], [4985, 5018, "PER"], [5032, 5041, "PER"], [5046, 5058, "PER"], [5084, 5091, "LOC"], [5145, 5150, "PER"], [5293, 5303, "PER"], [5312, 5317, "PER"]]}
{"id": 927, "text": "Forward\n Here Posted is the first TWO Chapters of a 25 Chapter Book. I wrote this 20 years ago, for fun, while trapped in the subway to and from work every day. Thought it might be intriguing to put it out there. I am just editing as I go along so the other chapters will come fast…..\n CHAPTER 1\n It had always been his practice to wake up at least an hour before his duty shift began. Besides the fact that it assured he was alert by the time he reported, he had always believed that a man should spend time in quiet meditation before he started his day. Of course now he had the power to spend as much time contemplating as he desired. After all, his duty shift may be twenty four hours a day, but being a commander in the Romulan Navy also afforded him the luxury of managing his time as he saw fit.\n Still, Commander S’Tal prided himself in his dedication to duty; not in a conceited, arrogant way, but with a fulfilling satisfaction that he was an honourable man. He had seen many a ship’s commander abuse his position and shirk his duty. Honour and duty was the fibre that made a good man; that was the heritage from which the Romulan Empire had grown and what would always remain in those who served the Romulan Way. Today, like most other days, he awoke to the beckoning of the computer’s masculine voice efficiently repeating a clipped military style wake up call. It did not take many conscious moments for his mind to turn to the upcoming mission.\n “Computer,” he spoke to an invisible speaker that he had always felt was in the ceiling even though he knew it was built into one of the walls. “Open the Starscape.” Open was not really the correct term since the wall did not actually open up into space. Instead, the computer adjusted the tint of the huge transplanium window that made up the wall curving into the ceiling of S’Tal’s quarters. It was not his style to use his position to get comforts that were not readily available to the rest of his crew. Nevertheless, he had indulged himself the luxury of the viewport he now looked through.\n Looking through the enormous window he could not help but be struck by what he saw. For all the trillions upon trillions of light years that made up the universe, when he looked out into space he was amazed at how two dimensional it all seemed. Every speck of light he saw could be an inch in radius and a few meters from his ship, or they could be a thousand times the radius of Romulus’ sun and a million light years away. No man had the eyes or mind to truly perceive the notion of depth in the vastness of space.\n S’Tal found the stars even more beautiful when he was actually viewing them with his own eyes, instead of the computer generated images he saw on the bridge. It was easy to get caught up in the aesthetic beauty of the stars, especially when they took on a surreal quality caused by the rippling effect the cloaking device created. Still, he had no time to spare daydreaming about the beauty of the stars when he needed to prepare for battle.\n The Praetor himself had endorsed this mission for which S’Tal, his ship, and the Vatrium were preparing. The Praetor had been convinced by his advisors that the time was right to move against the Federation. They argued that for too long now the Romulan Empire had been denying their true destiny as masters of the galaxy because they feared themselves not strong enough to conquer the Federation.  Now those advisers had convinced the Praetor that the empire was strong enough to win   if they could gain an early advantage.  The purpose of this mission was to give them that advantage.\n The years of peace had been good to the Empire; her people had grown as a society and had conquered or settled hundreds of new planets.  Honour lay with the military and duty was served by all.  S’Tal had gained his position through outstanding military service in wars with the Gorn and the IKS on the Triangle border.  He had seen war and understood the necessity to wage it.  However, this action against the Federation was different; it did not feel right for him, or for the Empire.  He did not fear for himself – in fact, he looked forward to dying in his Commander’s seat, as a real warrior should.  He feared for what the war would do to the Romulan society.  Regardless of what the Praetor’s advisors said, the war with the Federation would be long and costly.\n S’Tal had never actually battled a Starfleet vessel, but was well studied in their design and abilities.  It was this expertise that led to his assignment on this particular mission.  For all of the Empire’s technical advancements, his ship, one of the most powerful in the Royal Navy, was barely a match for many of the Federation’s cruisers. Romulan commanders were superior when their positions had been earned – of that he was sure -, but too many command positions had been given to undeserving men who knew someone of importance.  So where was the advantage in a war with the Federation?  S’Tal knew he would be successful in completing his mission, but whether it would give the Empire the element of surprise and superior knowledge remained a question.\n S’Tal got out of bed, went over to the food synthesizer, and returned to the small table that was set up against his wall viewport.  He was far too preoccupied with the mission that would begin today to worry about a proper breakfast.  This morning a cup of hot corum would suffice.  He sipped his root broth as he wondered how honourable it was to fight the Federation, who had shown no aggression to the Empire.  When he was a young man, S’Tal had thought that fighting was always a source of honour.  As he aged, the fighting seemed endless and killing his so called enemy often seemed like hurting innocent people.  More and more, S’Tal was coming to the realization that true honour lay in protecting peace and the strength of the Empire.  If it took war to do that, then so be it.  He did not feel this was the case with the Federation, which was, for the most part, an honourable entity.\n That last thought brought an audible chuckle from his throat.  As a Centurion aboard the Cl’Torin he had been furious at the espionage of a Federation captain and his first officer who conspired to steal a cloaking device.  S’Tal had been severely reprimanded for his inability to destroy the Federation vessel when it was fleeing with a stolen Romulan cloaking device.  S’Tal had been slow to react to the Enterprise cloaking and it escaped.\n It was his anger at being duped that drove him to be so great a warrior.  He also vowed to become the foremost expert on Federation military organization.  He found that his anger ran out of steam after a couple of years. His Commander later showed him that Federation officers were capable of great honour when that same command crew of the Enterprise worked together with her against Omne. She had been right to trust them even though her career was lost.  He actually developed an admiration for Starfleet and its most powerful ships and decorated officers.\n Still, of course his heart lay with his Romulan Empire.  He had fought for the prosperity of its people.  He had sworn his life to the Praetor and regardless of the consequences or possible futility of war with the Federation, he was going to honour his oath.  Duty was the utmost priority to Romulans   and S’Tal was, above all else, a Romulan.  With renewed determination, he rose from his seat and began to dress in his Romulan commander’s uniform.\n “Close viewport.”  The viewport darkened on cue as S’Tal added the honour sash to his uniform.  He reached up to the Romulan Bird cluster that held his sash in place and touched it with his forefinger.  It beeped to life.  “S’Tal to bridge,” he clipped in an efficient military tone.  “I’m heading to PTB room three.  Inform Commander Tark that I will be transporting over as scheduled.”\n “Immediately, Commander,” S’Tal heard as he left his quarters.\n Tark revelled in the command seat.  He often spent many off duty hours on the bridge.  He had spent years of his life in the security sections of various ships, dreaming of getting to where he was now   in the command seat.\n It was from the command seat that one could be part of the strategy of battle.  He was addicted to combat, he could admit that.  This was not a vice to a Romulan, provided he had self control and could make the right choices about when to battle, always ensuring the Empire came before personal needs.\n Many years of his life had been spent studying every great strategist in the known galaxy.  It did not matter to Tark whether the object of his study was an enemy or an ally, his admiration transcended political and ideological boundaries.  In fact, some of his favourite strategists were from the Klingon and Federation starfleets.  Captain Garth was his chosen commander when it came to fighting against numerous opponents.  General Kord from the Klingon Empire was outstanding at directing and participating in multi vessel encounters.  Yet his favourite was Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the Federation cruiser Enterprise.  It was Kirk who was able to turn any situation to his advantage.  Kirk, who never accepted defeat even if he had to sacrifice his own ship to win.\n Tark had spent several years as captain on smaller ships, most of them old and lacking any real power.  It was his knowledge of Kirk and his expertise on combat strategy that got him command of the Vatrium.  His ship was the first of its kind, the first special missions cruiser in the Imperial Fleet.  It had the power to beat the best from the Federation.  Still, he could only hope that it would come to battle with Federation ships, hope to meet Kirk in combat someday.  Nevertheless, it was his duty to ensure the success of this mission regardless of the cost; even if he had to give up the chance to battle Kirk.\n Success ensured power.  He would command as long as he was successful.  Command was what he wanted most in life.  As he looked around the bridge at his crew, it occurred to him that they were his to command.  As long as they were on his ship, their lives were his to control, they were extensions of himself on the bridge.  The communications officer was his ears and voice to communicate with others.  His helm and Nav officers were his legs to take him where he wanted to go.  Fists to pound the enemy were provided by his weapons officer, and his engineer was a doctor to care for the body.  The bridge was the brain of the ship and he was the brain of the bridge.\n He could not resist smiling to himself.  Here he was a Romulan commander, and he was comparing his ship to his body and himself to a brain; such were not the musings of a Romulan.  He moved his attention from his inward thoughts to the main viewscreen.  The now split screen showed the forward starfield on one half and a navigational projection on the other.  The navigational projection showed his ship’s location alongside the frigate K’Lester, the two starship’s course projection, and the border markings that represented the Triangle and Federation neutral zone boundaries.\n Tark turned to his science officer’s station, “Any ships on long range sensors yet?”\n “Nothing yet, sir,” the man answered quickly.  “We should be within scanner range of any enemy vessel patrolling the Federation side of the Neutral Zone and the Triangle boarder in…1 hour, 22 minutes.”\n “Excellent, inform me as soon as you detect anything.”\n “Yes sir.” The officer firmly punched the left side of his chest and then extended his arm so that his hand was just above the level of his shoulder.\n “Commander,” came the call of his communications officer from his post beside the science station.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[725, 737, "ORG"], [811, 826, "PER"], [1133, 1147, "GPE"], [1837, 1842, "PER"], [2438, 2445, "LOC"], [2576, 2581, "PER"], [3023, 3030, "PER"], [3075, 3080, "PER"], [3128, 3135, "PER"], [3215, 3225, "GPE"], [3265, 3279, "GPE"], [3405, 3415, "GPE"], [3455, 3462, "PER"], [3648, 3654, "GPE"], [3803, 3808, "PER"], [3887, 3891, "SPEC"], [3900, 3903, "SHIP"], [3911, 3919, "LOC"], [4020, 4030, "GPE"], [4088, 4094, "GPE"], [4258, 4265, "SPEC"], [4299, 4306, "PER"], [4379, 4384, "PER"], [4341, 4351, "GPE"], [4414, 4423, "ORG"], [4578, 4584, "GPE"], [4653, 4663, "ORG"], [4700, 4710, "GPE"], [4723, 4730, "SPEC"], [4961, 4971, "GPE"], [4974, 4979, "PER"], [5065, 5071, "GPE"], [5141, 5146, "PER"], [5500, 5510, "GPE"], [5547, 5553, "GPE"], [5581, 5586, "PER"], [5776, 5781, "PER"], [5972, 5982, "GPE"], [5877, 5883, "GPE"], [6126, 6134, "SHIP"], [6177, 6187, "GPE"], [6261, 6266, "PER"], [6330, 6340, "GPE"], [6382, 6389, "GPE"], [6408, 6413, "PER"], [6444, 6454, "SHIP"], [6602, 6612, "GPE"], [6707, 6716, "PER"], [6739, 6749, "GPE"], [6823, 6833, "SHIP"], [6867, 6871, "PER"], [6980, 6989, "ORG"], [7083, 7097, "GPE"], [7178, 7185, "PER"], [7258, 7268, "GPE"], [7336, 7344, "SPEC"], [7351, 7356, "PER"], [7380, 7387, "SPEC"], [7466, 7473, "SPEC"], [7547, 7552, "PER"], [7613, 7620, "SPEC"], [7720, 7725, "PER"], [7797, 7811, "LOC"], [7821, 7835, "PER"], [7899, 7908, "PER"], [7911, 7916, "PER"], [7949, 7953, "PER"], [8328, 8335, "SPEC"], [8441, 8447, "GPE"], [8590, 8594, "PER"], [8811, 8824, "PER"], [8787, 8797, "GPE"], [8904, 8916, "PER"], [8926, 8940, "GPE"], [9039, 9060, "PER"], [9079, 9089, "SPEC"], [9098, 9108, "SHIP"], [9118, 9122, "PER"], [9177, 9181, "PER"], [9259, 9263, "PER"], [9387, 9391, "PER"], [9457, 9464, "SHIP"], [3100, 3107, "SHIP"], [8775, 8782, "GPE"], [9545, 9559, "ORG"], [9605, 9615, "GPE"], [9678, 9688, "GPE"], [9709, 9713, "PER"], [9873, 9877, "PER"], [10018, 10024, "LOC"], [10195, 10201, "LOC"], [10479, 10485, "LOC"], [10604, 10611, "SPEC"], [10540, 10546, "LOC"], [10720, 10727, "SPEC"], [10987, 10995, "SHIP"], [11080, 11088, "LOC"], [11093, 11116, "LOC"], [11130, 11134, "PER"], [11356, 11368, "LOC"], [11333, 11343, "GPE"], [11377, 11385, "LOC"], [11627, 11636, "PER"]]}
{"id": 928, "text": "“What is it Centurion?”\n “The K’Lester informs us that Commander S’Tal will be transporting over on schedule.”\n “Confirm,” Tark answered, and then added as he headed for the speedlift, “I will be in PTB room one to meet him.”\n Tark enjoyed S’Tal’s company, they shared many of the same interests.  There were so few men in the Empire with whom he could talk to about some of the Federation’s greatest strategists.  Since being assigned to this mission, he and S’Tal had spent many hours in simulated starship battle with the simusence helmets and he looked forward to one more before the mission operations began.  Tark had a special recreated simulation that had just been programmed based on a recent event in the Federation. He wanted to run the new simulation with S’Tal.\n  \n CHAPTER 2\n Captain’s Log, Stardate 2/2305.28:\n The Enterprise’s‚ first four weeks of patrol duty on the Triangle boarder have concluded without any serious incidents. As is often the case on long and uneventful patrol duty, the crew is losing concentration and becoming bored. I am sending a recommendation to Starfleet, that following the six weeks of our patrol duty, the crew of the Enterprise be given shoreleave on the planet of Lakeland. The two Federation patrol vessels immediately adjacent to us have also reported no note worthy incidents. The Sputnik‚ in the sector to the galactic north of the Enterprise‚   has monitored no activity in its sector and has completed resupply of Outpost 1 along the Romulan Neutral Zone. The Appollo‚ to the galactic south has reported a tediously sparse amount of activity in its sector bordering the Triangle.\n Captain James T. Kirk wearily pushed the button on the arm of his command chair that switched off the log recording device.  The thought of continuing patrol duty for another six weeks was devitalizing to say the least. Yet he felt at ease now; now that he was no longer behind a desk. There was a time when he had thought setting fleet procedure behind a desk would be preferable to patrol duty. After experiencing the life of a staff officer, he was resolute that his calling in life was to command a starship   to command the Enterprise. He looked around at his bridge and the efficient crew, who by merely pushing buttons and flicking switches, made the 170,000 megaton Enterprise fly through space at speeds many times faster than the speed of light. He could think of no words to express his feelings at that time. He felt a mix of awe at the thought of travelling at such an incredible speed, and genuine feelings of loyalty for and from his crew – his friends, no, his family.\n He knew that it was, in many ways, egotistical to think of the Enterprise and her crew as his, but he often found himself doing just that when he sat in the command chair. There could be no doubt that this chair was his. Looking back now, he found it hard to believe that he had ever given up his ship and taken the appointment as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Even more incredible that he had given her up a second time after the V’GER incident. Those years spent in a desk chair he had constantly dreamed and hoped of again sitting in the command chair of the Enterprise. Now he was and he would not easily give her up again.\n The previous five years had seen three serious threats on Terra and the Federation of Planets. He had lived through all of them. His ship, his crew were heroes, but there were heavy casualties. The Enterprise and her crew had paid for their heroes’ welcome with their dearest blood. James Kirk had lost the son he had only briefly known but had loved as much as any father could. It had taken Kirk several long introspective hours and several long talks with Dr. McCoy to realize that it was his friends on the Enterprise that were his family. Still, there could be little reconciliation for the losses he felt.\n Nevertheless, all was how it should be once again. The first watch surrounded him, everything felt right. Uhura was at her communication console, her fingers moving across its dimensions as they had for so many years. She seemed to have aged the most gracefully, he decided. She was perhaps even more handsome a woman now than in her younger years.\n To her left was the familiar back of Mr. Spock. Kirk was very pleased when Spock had told him that he would stay on the Enterprise as First Officer and Science Department Head. Spock had been satisfied with his role as a Starfleet instructor, but had felt the strongest emotion that Vulcans will admit to having – curiosity. He had a desire to discover things that had never before been discovered, to understand things as yet not understood, to go where no one has gone before. It was this last phrase, to “go where no man has gone before “, that had made Spock decide to request starship duty aboard the Enterprise.  Spock had told Kirk when he filed his request to stay on board the Enterprise, that he had been reminded of his own personal charter by reading the Enterprise’s. Spock had always known the charter of the Enterprise, but it was during that time when the Captain, McCoy and himself were locked in the forward observation deck by Spock’s brother that he had the opportunity to really contemplate the importance of the Enterprise and her crew to what he was; to what he had become. He had come to the realization that it was the duty aboard the starship with his friends that truly fulfilled his one true destiny – and made him content. It was a statement to which Kirk had no argument, so even though it meant Spock giving up his command, Jim Kirk had processed and endorsed the request.\n Directly in front of him, Kirk rested his eyes on the team that had guided the Enterprise through more kilometres of space than any other ship in Starfleet history. Chekov had turned down a promotion to command a vessel of his own to stay aboard the Enterprise as Department Head for Security and Weapons System, as well as third in the chain of command. Kirk remembered his misgivings about Chekov turning down the promotion. Chekov was adamant however, he would continue to learn from the best until it was time for him to move up to command the Enterprise.\n Sulu was a mainstay in Jim Kirk’s crew, Kirk knew that Sulu would stay on the Enterprise for as long as they would allow him.  Sulu had piloted the ship in every battle manoeuvre in Starfleet’s combat textbooks as well as some that would be added to them. He flew the Enterprise like it was an extension of himself. Sulu also could have had a command position on a ship of his own but had made it clear to Kirk that he was going to wait for a chance to command the Excelsior. He had told Kirk that there was no reason to leave the best ship in the fleet unless he had the chance to command a ship he could make the best.\n To the Captain’s far left, sitting with his back to the command chair watching his instruments as though the ship were in a battle was the one man who loved the Enterprise as much as Jim Kirk did – of that he was sure. Montgomery Scott would also stay with the Enterprise until he was forced to retire. Scotty had revelled at the prospect of spending his days in this new Enterprise. Kirk remembered what Scotty had said when he learned of the new Enterprise’s equipment, “Ach, me baby’s finally got the best equipment thot Starfleet has ta offer. And ’tis about time too, a shame it took her destruction for those inept fools ta realize it.” It was Scotty who had complained the loudest about the new Enterprise not being as good as the old . It had not deterred him however; he continued to work her into shape and when the time had come, she performed beautifully and saved the lives of all aboard her. It was not long after the trip to the centre of the galaxy that Scotty was again claiming that the new Enterprise was befitting the name and was his baby. “After all,” Scotty had told Kirk, “it was those inept fools at Starfleet w’at ha’ put her tagether wrong.” The memory brought a broad grin to Jim Kirk’s face.\n “Now what’s that grin for? You look like the cat that swallowed the bird, “came the voice of the Enterprise’s Chief Medical Officer and Kirk’s long-time friend and companion. McCoy had grumbled about signing for the five year mission. He had claimed that he would be old and grey by the time he got back, and that space exploration was no way for a man to be spending his twilight years. Someone had to take care of Kirk, though, and he had decided that he was the only man alive capable of having any effect on what Jim Kirk did.\n “Hello Bones, I was just thinking back to Scotty’s comments about his baby finally getting the best from the inept fools at Starfleet,” Kirk answered instigatively. The remark had its desired affect for Spock’s head popped up from his watch over the science console. Kirk felt the weariness of patrol duty lift off his shoulders as he straightened for the exchanges that were sure to ensue.\n “Captain, I was unaware that Mr. Scott was involved in the conception of the Enterprise, and in fact, that conception of an inanimate object was possible,” Spock offered without even a trace of sarcasm. He had learned long ago that while working with humans it was important to their morale – and therefore their efficiency – for them to have a nearly constant environment of humour. It was for this reason that he allowed himself to partake in their bantering back and forth as the “straight man “. It was logical.\n “Spock,” answered Dr. McCoy, “surely you must have realized that it was only a joke and that Scotty was not suggesting that he had a biological part in the Enterprise’s creation.”\n “Ah yes,” offered the Vulcan, again without even a hint of humour in his voice or face. “Humour is an abstract human concept.  I have not yet mastered recognizing or understanding it, Doctor.” Every head on the bridge was now turned to listen to the conversation. The bridge crew of the first watch were frequently treated to dialogues between Spock and McCoy. These dialogues were quite often humorous and always interesting. Since he was one of the subjects of this particular conversation, Scotty had turned from his console and was listening intently. “Ach, but ya donna understand,” Scotty jumped in, speaking not to just Spock but to McCoy and Kirk as well. “The Enterprise is me baby just as surely as if I ha’ given birth ta the lass meself.”\n Although there was no humour meant in Scotty’s statement, Kirk’s and McCoy’s faces lit up with the widest grins. They themselves were unsure of the motives behind the grins. Perhaps it was simply an acknowledgement of how Scotty felt about the Enterprise, similar to the smile given any mother when she talked of her child. But perhaps the smiles that these grown men were flashing so brightly were because they knew that Spock could not let such an illogical statement go unchallenged. The fact that Spock gave his “interesting but very illogical ” eyebrow raise confirmed their assessment of Spock’s reaction.\n “Mr. Scott,” Spock settled into his Vulcan mode readying himself for another attempt – however futile – at righting an illogical presumption. The fact that he was even pursuing a dialogue that would, at its conclusion, not change Mr. Scott’s paternal feelings concerning the Enterprise did not deter him from the attempt. “Might I remind you that the Enterprise is owned by Starfleet Command and that it is neither a “baby” nor a ” lass “.”\n “Mr. Spock!… sir,” the Scotsman answered indignantly. “I may nota’ drawn up the plans ta the darlin’ or commissioned her assemblin’, but as sure as I’m standin’ here, I’m the one thot takes care a’ her and makes her whot she is. And Mr. Spock, she is a baby. She has to be coddled and caressed ta ge’ her ta perform as she does. As for bein’ a lass, could anythin’ so beautiful not be a true lady?” Scotty was speaking the truth about how he felt concerning the Enterprise. It was his baby.  Scotty also knew the problem Spock’s logical mind would have understanding the engineer’s feelings. He continued with the conversation for the sheer enjoyment of talking about the Enterprise and the dismay it would cause the Vulcan.\n “Mr. Scott,” the Vulcan First Officer offered. “You may have made the other Enterprise what it was previous to its destruction, but I suggest that this Enterprise is as yet unchanged by your hand and is therefore not your “baby “.”  The smiles disappeared from the faces of the bridge crew. The fact that he could have just deeply hurt Montgomery Scott did not occur to Spock until Kirk answered to Spock’s comment.\n “The thing you don’t understand Spock, is that the spirit of the Enterprise lives on in this vessel and in fact is carried by the crew that lives within her.” Kirk realized that he had been far too sentimental with his statement but he felt it was needed to raise the morale of his disenchanted Chief Engineer. He also knew that Spock would pick up on the fact that he had touched on a taboo subject and that it was time to end the conversation. “The metal may be new, some of the people may be new, but she is the Enterprise, there’s no doubt about that.” There were times during the mission with Sybok that Kirk had doubted just that. Not anymore, the Enterprise had proven herself.\n “Yes, of course. Mr. Scott, please accept my apology if I have given offence.” Spock answered right on cue to the Captain’s  – Was it mental – communication. Spock had mind melded with his commanding officer and friend on several occasions and in fact had created a mental link on occasion to keep in contact with the captain when that was the only form of communication possible. He had also thought that he had severed the thread that had joined the two men. Now he felt unsure; unsure of the presence of the link or if his feelings of camaraderie had just taught him to read his captains hints and hunches. Then, what is the difference?\n “Ach, Donna worry yourself Mr. Spock. You couldna’ known. Besides thot, I may be the mother o’ the Enterprise, but with all thot ye have added ta her you are atleast an uncle,..sir.” Scotty answered innocently. Again the faces of the bridge crew were lit up with giant Cheshire grins and Spock’s eyebrow rose underneath his hairline.\n “Indeed,” was all that Spock could or would say.

{"id": 929, "text": "“I’d love to Bones, but unfortunately I have other, more strenuous, plans. ”\n At this comment McCoy looked towards Uhura and leaned closer to Jim Kirk’s ear as if to avoid the possibility of being overheard. “You have a date then. I guess I can take rejection as long as she’s beautiful. Who is it this time? the girl from Life Sup…”\n Kirk cut him off before McCoy had a chance to recite a list of every woman on the ship to whom Kirk had mentioned a slight attraction. “I have the playoffs of the energyclub tournament tonight. Thanks anyway Bones.”\n “Jim, why do you continue to enter yourself in Security’s combat tournaments? You know you’re getting too old for that sort of thing.” McCoy purposely put the emphasis on old; after all, if they could not tease each other, who could they tease? There was a real, tangible bond between the two officers and friends. They had been through life and death – or close enough – together.  There had been nothing that had not been said between them, there was nothing that could not be said now –  no matter how bruising the subject may be.\n “I have an obligation as this ship’s commander to keep up with all the latest personal combat techniques,” Captain Kirk answered as though he were reading from a Starfleet Captain’s Handbook. There was no way he was going to give his tormentor the pleasure of showing any discomfort. “Besides that Bones, how many times have I had to fight to secure the safety of the Enterprise and her crew?” The memories of those times flashed back to him. The Gorn incident, the Excalbia incident when Kirk had to watch his hero Abraham Lincoln die, the fight in the arena of the Gamesters of Triskelion, and others were all still fresh in his mind, as were the fears and desperation he had felt.\n It was obvious from McCoy’s face that he was searching for a point from which he could argue. Not finding one, he decided to settle for a cynical remark. “You won’t be able to fight for the security of anything if you’re in sickbay on your back from a silly security tournament.”\n Kirk seemed amused by the whole exchange. It was always enjoyable to argue with McCoy, especially when the Doctor lost and resorted to cynicism – a sure sign he was frustrated. All that was needed now was to smile, this would serve to annoy McCoy more than another remark.\n McCoy knew when he was beaten. He turned his attention from the Captain to the Engineer.\n “Scotty, how about you? care to join me for a bite to eat? I know you wouldn’t be fool enough to enter into a security combat tournament.”\n “Aye, surely I wouldna’. But I canna’ join ya for dinner Doctor, for though I wouldna’ enter meself, I wouldna’ miss the cap’ain in the finals o’ such a tournament,” Scotty answered then added. “Why don’t ya join me Doc? ‘Tis gonna’ be a great final.”\n “Has the whole ship gone crazy? Do we not partake in enough violence in our travels that we need to volunteer our spare time to beat up on each other.” McCoy bellowed at no one in particular but soon turned to Mr. Spock. “Well then Mr. Spock, I guess it’s just you and me. I may not have a lot of fun at dinner but at least I’ll have some company.”\n Spock turned his chair so that he could face the Doctor.\n “Thank you for the gracious invitation Doctor, but I am also attending the tournament as a spectator.”\n “You Mr. Spock? Why would you want to watch such a barbaric display of violence?” McCoy brightened at the chance for another argument. He was anxious to redeem himself for the quick defeat at the Captain’s hands moments earlier. He saw Spock’s desire to watch the tournament as illogical and felt sure he could prove that watching violence was as bad as partaking. I’ve got him on this one.\n “As a doctor yourself, surely you must recognize the benefit of physical activity to the healthy upkeep of any humanoid being,” Spock answered. He knew that he was entering into a discussion with Dr.McCoy that the doctor would treat as an argument and verbally fight with aggression far more ferocious than the physical sparring that would occur in a combat tournament aboard the Enterprise.\n “Physical activity I have no problem with. Callisthenics and other forms of non-violent activities can produce the desired physiological benefits.” Yes! Good answer. Spock can’t get out of this one. No Way.\n “I have noticed, during my stay with humans, that they often require the excitement of competition to push themselves to an activity level conducive to physical fitness improvement.”\n “There are many forms of non-violent sports that can be participated in that are very competitive.” McCoy seemed to get more confident each time he answered one of Spock’s comments. I’m going to win this one.\n “That is true Dr. McCoy, but none of those sports also offer the added benefit of improving the proficiency level of a necessary skill aboard a military vessel. Surely as Chief Medical Officer you can see the importance of military personnel being proficient in a skill that could someday save their lives and lower the need for spending time under your care.” There was an air of finality in Spock’s statement. Neither he, nor any one of the bridge crew, expected an answer from Dr. McCoy and doubted that the doctor could provide one.\n McCoy again got a pained look on his face. His eyebrows slanted inward and downward into an expression that was alarmingly similar to a child’s when the cookie jar is taken away and placed out of reach. Still he had to say something. He couldn’t think of a good retort so he again searched for a cynical remark to bail him out.\n “I …” McCoy was interrupted by the opening of the turbolift doors. The second watch crew came through the doors and made their way to their respective posts. The commotion caused by the crew exchange rescued McCoy from finishing his remark and allowed him to exit the bridge before anyone thought to look to the Doctor to hear the rest of his retort. Well they’re not the calvary, McCoy thought to himself. But they did come in the nick of time. At least I don’t have to make things worse by saying something that would only be conceding to Spock. I’ll concede to Jim, but never to Spock.

As it resealed itself behind him, he noted Doctor Beverly Crusher, near\n the center of the room.\n Crusher’s normally professional manner was interrupted when she saw\n who entered. Her facial expression betrayed a this-is-it look, which Data\n recognized from a quick scan of his human-watching file. It meant she had\n something to tell him which she felt was going to be difficult for one or both of\n them.\n “You sent for me, Doctor,” he informed her, pleasantly.\n She tried to keep a steady gaze into his yellow-tinted eyes, but found that\n her own were disobediently wandering about.\n “Uh…yes, Data. There is something here which requires your presence,\n and I’m not sure which one of us is going to need to sit down more when I tell you\n what that is.”\n She had rehearsed this moment in her mind for some time, but now was\n struck mute. It didn’t help that she wasn’t quite able to believe the facts, herself.

{"id": 626, "text": "Q-Logy\n By Jeff Stoneking\n CHAPTER ONE\n So this was what it was like to be dead?  Consciousness dissipating as the void all around stretches endlessly and no escape is in sight, and an unsettling feeling that there may be no God after all?  Or perhaps there was a God, a single Creator who had deemed that the entity was destined to spend the rest of eternity separated from Him.  Maybe this was a transitional phase in reincarnation, or perhaps the mythical place commonly referred to as purgatory by corporeal life forms.  Being dead for the first time, and seeing that none other of his species had experienced death, the entity didn’t really know what to expect, though various books, religious and secular, had postulated theories throughout the millennia.  For all he knew, the entity would just as well end up in Heaven or Hell, Sto’vo’kor or Gre’thor, or in the Divine Treasury or the Vault of Eternal Destitution, or simply no where at all.  After all, being part of a species that never died, would any of those places welcome him willingly?  He once was a God, so what God would want him to spend eternity with Him?\n “I think,” the entity thought, recalling that was the tell tale sign of being simply a being.  However, the thought took no substance, and seemed to touch nothing in time.  The entity was pulled out of all that was called home, all that was called familiar.  The entity thought, but only unto itself.  “I think yet I think not; I think not and I am dead.”\n With this thought, there was no substance, no root of any kind or reality.  The entity reached out beyond itself into the deep reaches of the cosmos.  If there was an afterlife, the entity was determined to find it.  Unfortunately, nothing answered back.  For the entity’s entire life, there had been a multitudinous array of voices in his head.  The entity had been part of a great societal experiment, never being alone, never being without reach of the arms of comrades or beyond the grasp of their words.  Now the entity was all alone, thinking what might have been the last thought.  Why was the entity being punished so horribly?  Was the execution?  Excommunication?  The entity forgot the details that lead up to this horrific solitude.  There was the vibrancy of life, the wonderment of it all, then nothing.  Emptiness, space, and silence. Would these be the companions of the entity though the rest of eternity?  The entity always wanted to live forever, and kept on telling others that it would live forever, but now the thought of a true eternity terrified the entity.  The entity cried, and it cried out to whoever might listen, but would anybody hear?\n Guinan, off duty and soaking in the beauty of the arboretum, noticed something slightly awry.  She gazed over at Keiko O’Brien, who was fixing her attention on planting seeds she received from Forchin.  Keiko had complained about the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables aboard the Enterprise, stating that replicator technology had a far way to go.  As she was planting yet another seed, her eyes lost their lock on her work and she looked up at Guinan.  There was something awry.\n “Guinan,” Keiko started, “what brings you up here?\n Guinan had entered the arboretum after Keiko and, apparently, Guinan had not noticed Keiko, as her concentration seemed to be broken slightly with Keiko’s question.  “It’s peaceful up here,” Guinan replied with a smile.  “It’s one of those few places one can go on the ship and forget that you are in space.  It’s a nice retreat.”\n “I suppose so,” smiled Keiko.  “You must be reminded all the time you are in space working in Ten-Forward.  Of course, there always is the holodeck.”\n “Oh, I don’t go into the holodeck much unless Jean Luc or somebody else might invite me along for an adventure.  I prefer to relax in more realistic settings,” Guinan replied.\n There was something awry.  Keiko could sense unease in Guinan, as if she was making small talk but there was something charging through her mind at that moment that caused her to be detached from the present.  She felt Guinan had not simply come to the arboretum to be away from the feeling of being on a star ship, but something was preoccupying her, and even though Guinan replied to all of Keiko’s comments, Keiko still felt as if Guinan was not even talking to anybody in particular, really.  Guinan could not even keep in eye contact with Keiko and were in constant gaze out the windows.  Keiko turned her head up and looked out the window.  It was simply a star field, an odd choice for somebody to focus on when they just claimed they wanted to get away from the feeling of being in space.  “What is it?” Keiko asked, hoping to get responses out of Guinan that were perhaps more truthful.\n “I don’t know.  We’re on route to Wadi Besor,” Guinan replied, “but I feel as if we shouldn’t go.  I felt something earlier, a disturbance of some sort.  I can’t describe it entirely, nor even understand it myself.”\n Keiko nodded.  She could not describe in concrete language either, but she sensed something was unusual, as if things were not the same anymore.  “Something is happening but I don’t know what.  From what I’ve seen, everything appears to be status quo.”\n “Yes,” Guinan nodded.  “Status quo.  That’s what they want us to think, anyway.”\n Keiko did not know what to say to that, or how to even how to think she should take it.  At that moment, Miles O’Brien came over Keiko’s com badge, “Keiko, I can’t get off of duty right now to get Molly from the day care.  Do you think you could get her now?”\n “Sure thing, Miles,” Keiko replied, relieved that she had a chance to get away from Guinan.  “Sorry, Guinan, but I have to go,” Keiko said awkwardly as she excused herself.\n Guinan just nodded as if she was unattached from the moment.  As Keiko took her leave of the arboretum, Guinan simply continued to watch out the window as if looking for something, or perhaps expecting something.\n It was not first in the arboretum that Guinan felt this way, however.  It first occurred to her moments after she left Ten Forward, as she walked down the halls of the Enterprise.  Every curve of the corridors, the nuance of each computer console, down to the locations of the Jefferies Tubes caused an odd sensation to course through Guinan’s being.  Yet, all was the same as it has always been.\n “Computer,” Guinan said with hesitation in the arboretum, not sure what to expect, “what ship is this?”\n “This is the USS Enterprise,” the computer spoke back, “registry number NCC-1701-D.”\n That is exactly what Guinan thought she would hear, yet she almost expected to hear something else.  “That,” she said softly and slowly through her lips, “is not right.”  She paused with unease, worry, and confusion forming in her brow and then said, “Computer, locate Captain Picard.”\n “Captain Picard is deceased,” the computer responded as if giving a weather report.  “Date of death: stardate 44741.9.”\n Guinan leaned up against the nearest wall and the words of the computer had barely penetrated her mind and her thoughts.  Something more ominous seemed to emanate from somewhere outside the ship, something she felt and heard all around her, inside her.  It was coming closer, though she could not yet see it.  Out there, beyond the blackness of space, something was coming and it felt terrible.\n “Miles!” Keiko called out down the corridor.  He was walking out of the transporter room, apparently just getting off duty.  Keiko had Molly in her arms as she quickened her pace to meet up with her husband.  “I was just with Guinan in the arboretum.  She is acting awfully strange.”\n Miles chuckled, “As if that’s a surprise?”\n “Seriously, Miles!” Keiko continued.  “I know she can be rather eccentric, but she really has me concerned.  She really seemed to be concerned about our recent mission to Wadi Besor andÉ”\n “Wait a minute?” Miles interrupted.  “How does she know about that?”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[11, 25, "PER"], [278, 285, "PER"], [489, 498, "LOC"], [820, 826, "LOC"], [830, 834, "LOC"], [836, 846, "LOC"], [850, 858, "LOC"], [870, 885, "LOC"], [893, 921, "LOC"], [2653, 2659, "PER"], [2766, 2779, "PER"], [2703, 2712, "LOC"], [2846, 2853, "PER"], [2856, 2861, "PER"], [2934, 2944, "SHIP"], [3099, 3105, "PER"], [3136, 3142, "PER"], [3145, 3150, "PER"], [3187, 3193, "PER"], [3210, 3219, "LOC"], [3226, 3231, "PER"], [3249, 3255, "PER"], [3272, 3277, "PER"], [3334, 3341, "PER"], [3378, 3384, "PER"], [3542, 3547, "PER"], [3613, 3624, "LOC"], [3658, 3666, "LOC"], [3695, 3703, "LOC"], [3716, 3724, "PER"], [3830, 3836, "PER"], [3874, 3879, "PER"], [3902, 3908, "PER"], [4066, 4072, "PER"], [4100, 4109, "LOC"], [4215, 4221, "PER"], [4240, 4247, "PER"], [4258, 4263, "PER"], [4281, 4287, "PER"], [4344, 4350, "PER"], [4391, 4396, "PER"], [4441, 4446, "PER"], [4659, 4664, "PER"], [4703, 4709, "PER"], [4778, 4788, "LOC"], [4791, 4797, "PER"], [4961, 4966, "PER"], [5222, 5228, "PER"], [5297, 5302, "PER"], [5402, 5415, "PER"], [5426, 5433, "PER"], [5446, 5451, "PER"], [5494, 5499, "PER"], [5571, 5576, "PER"], [5579, 5584, "PER"], [5642, 5648, "PER"], [5659, 5665, "PER"], [5686, 5691, "PER"], [5732, 5738, "PER"], [5797, 5802, "PER"], [5825, 5834, "LOC"], [5836, 5842, "PER"], [5970, 5979, "LOC"], [5985, 5991, "PER"], [6065, 6076, "LOC"], [6114, 6124, "SHIP"], [6281, 6289, "PER"], [6356, 6362, "PER"], [6466, 6476, "SHIP"], [6556, 6562, "PER"], [6804, 6818, "PER"], [6823, 6837, "PER"], [6943, 6949, "PER"], [7340, 7345, "PER"], [7348, 7353, "PER"], [7464, 7469, "PER"], [7474, 7479, "PER"], [7565, 7571, "PER"], [7579, 7588, "LOC"], [7624, 7629, "PER"], [7680, 7685, "PER"], [7688, 7693, "PER"], [7839, 7849, "LOC"], [7874, 7879, "PER"]]}
{"id": 627, "text": "“I don’t know,” Keiko replied.  “I didn’t think I should even ask.  What’s the big deal?”\n “Well, our destinations aren’t usually broadcast over the ship,” Miles replied, “and this destination has been kept quiet among the senior crew.”\n “Why?  What’s on Wadi Besor?”\n “It’s the home world of the Taecate,” Miles answered.  “I don’t know exactly why we are going there, but I do know that Captain Tutizi was stationed there on the Federation outpost there, and that he and the Captain were good friends.”\n “Captain Tutizi?” echoed Keiko.  “Wasn’t he murdered?”\n “Exactly,” Miles affirmed, “and as far as I know, his killer is still at large, which is why our trip to Wadi Besor isn’t being made public for the time being, in the event the murderer is on board the ship.  The security team is still investigating the potential that the killer may be on board.”\n “Oh, that’s absurd,” Keiko said.  “The Enterprise was nowhere near Wadi Besor at the time of Tutizi’s death.”\n “They are just keeping the possibility open, Keiko,” Miles said.\n “I don’t care,” insisted Keiko.  “It makes no sense to mark the Enterprise crew as a ship of suspects.  What about all the other ships in Starfleet?”\n “To tell the truth, Keiko, I am not entirely sure of all the ins and outs of this investigation.  What little I do know came from the official channels, which I can assure you.  Nobody is being charged as a suspect yet.  Nevertheless, that’s all beside the point.  I still cannot understand how Guinan knows we are going there.  UnlessÉ”\n “Miles, don’t trail off like that.  You know I hate when you do that.”\n “Well, it’s just that I helped out in stellar spectroscopy earlier today.  Commander Data and I were investigating an anomaly recently located near Wadi Besor.”\n “What kind of anomaly?” Keiko asked.\n “I don’t know,” Miles said.  “But I did see something like it before on one of our missions, I am almost certain of that.”\n “And what are you doing helping Data?  You’re not a science officer,” Keiko wondered.\n “It’s just stellar spectroscopy,” Miles replied.  “It’s pretty elementary stuff, really, and besides, I think it could help me in that promotion I am gunning for at Deep Space Nine.  It never hurts to broaden your horizons, so they say.  As a matter of fact, I am scheduled to go on duty in stellar spectroscopy in an hour.”\n “But you just got off of duty!” Keiko countered.\n “I might have to pull a few double shifts in the next few weeks,” O’Brien mentioned.  “Sorry, but this training for my promotion at Deep Space Nine is killing me too.  I am sure once we get to Deep Space Nine, we will have much more time to ourselves.”\n CHAPTER TWO\n The entity searched through the expanse of nothingness.  Searching for something, perhaps another dead soul wandering though this…this limbo?  The entity did not know what it was.  The blackness stretched seemingly from east to west, with no end in sight.  No throne, no God, no Prophets or wormhole aliens, no vaults or hordes of honored Klingons within any imaginable grasp within this void, not even an angel or a lesser deity made by humanoid hands.  No light, no door, no escape; the entity just drifted through nothing, and with each passing moment grew more weary and more depressed.  Where were the parties?  The fanfare music?  The singing choirs of seraphim?  The hordes of welcoming and willing virgins?  The entity began to question exactly where the eternal resting place would be.\n Unexpectedly, almost frightening the entity, something came up behind it.  The entity refocused his attention and could have smiled if it had a mouth:  It was another disembodied entity, and the entity recognized the second entity.  At last, a friend?\n “Come,” the Captain said, hearing his door chime but not looking up.\n The door slid and a silent presence flowed into the Captain’s ready room that made the Captain uneasy.  He looked up and saw Guinan standing there, as if she were trying to find the words to say.  “Guinan,” he began softly, “what can I do for you?”\n “How did Captain Picard die?” Guinan asked carefully, fearing she was going mad.\n “Guinan,” Captain Riker said with slight hesitation, “Captain Picard was assassinated seven years ago at an archaeological conference.”\n Guinan knew this but she also knew that it was horribly wrong.            In her mind, she was trying to place the pieces of the puzzle together, trying to reconcile what she felt was wrong with what she had known to be reality for all her life. She remembered how Commander Riker received the command of the Enterprise, which took place shortly after Captain Picard’s death.  She could clearly recall each step Riker took the Enterprise along the way:  She remembered how Riker confronted Soran, how Riker found himself in the Nexus and opted to go back far enough in time to save the Enterprise-D from destruction.  These were all things that she could remember as it was reality, but it was reality construed.  However, there was something deep inside her telling her that she had just talked to Captain Picard that morning, though her conscious mind had no recollection of the event.  “What?” she asked, almost as if she was merely arguing with her mind and not even talking to Captain Riker.\n “He was giving the keynote address and an assassin had bypassed security and made his way in with the team that had gathered for the conference.  The alien killed Captain Picard.”\n Guinan steadied herself and looked Riker straight in the eye.  “Captain Riker,” she said, the words sounding unnatural as they came out, “this isn’t right.”  She paused.  “The bridge, the people,” she said as she shook her head and looked around.  She paused a moment and added, “The ship.  What kind of ship is this?  What is its purpose?”\n “The Enterprise is a science vessel,” Riker replied.  “It has been ever since the peace treaty was made with the Vulcans and the Romulans.  Ambassador Spock had brought unification to the two worlds and the Klingons have focused their forces against the Cardassians.”\n “I know that,” Guinan conceded.  “Yet, I know that this is all wrong. This is a ship of exploration, yes, but it also a ship of peace and of defense.  It has greater potential than being a science vessel.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[16, 21, "PER"], [156, 161, "PER"], [255, 265, "LOC"], [297, 304, "SPEC"], [389, 403, "PER"], [431, 441, "GPE"], [477, 484, "PER"], [507, 520, "PER"], [531, 536, "PER"], [573, 578, "PER"], [667, 677, "LOC"], [775, 788, "ORG"], [882, 887, "PER"], [900, 910, "SHIP"], [928, 938, "LOC"], [954, 962, "PER"], [1017, 1022, "PER"], [1025, 1030, "PER"], [1063, 1068, "PER"], [1102, 1112, "SHIP"], [1176, 1185, "ORG"], [1209, 1214, "PER"], [1484, 1490, "PER"], [1529, 1534, "PER"], [1675, 1689, "PER"], [1748, 1758, "LOC"], [1786, 1791, "PER"], [1816, 1821, "PER"], [1956, 1960, "PER"], [1994, 1999, "PER"], [2045, 2050, "PER"], [2176, 2191, "LOC"], [2369, 2374, "PER"], [2453, 2460, "PER"], [2519, 2534, "LOC"], [2580, 2595, "LOC"], [2993, 3001, "SPEC"], [3715, 3722, "PER"], [3825, 3845, "LOC"], [3860, 3867, "PER"], [3898, 3904, "PER"], [3971, 3977, "PER"], [4032, 4046, "PER"], [4053, 4059, "PER"], [4106, 4112, "PER"], [4115, 4128, "PER"], [4159, 4173, "PER"], [4242, 4248, "PER"], [4507, 4522, "PER"], [4551, 4561, "SHIP"], [4594, 4610, "PER"], [4654, 4659, "PER"], [4669, 4679, "SHIP"], [4715, 4720, "PER"], [4732, 4737, "PER"], [4743, 4748, "PER"], [4770, 4775, "LOC"], [4828, 4840, "SHIP"], [5041, 5055, "PER"], [5224, 5237, "PER"], [5403, 5417, "PER"], [5421, 5427, "PER"], [5456, 5461, "PER"], [5485, 5498, "PER"], [5597, 5603, "LOC"], [5768, 5778, "SHIP"], [5801, 5806, "PER"], [5876, 5883, "SPEC"], [5892, 5900, "SPEC"], [5903, 5919, "PER"], [5970, 5978, "SPEC"], [6017, 6028, "SPEC"], [6047, 6053, "PER"]]}

I’ve encountered others but they seemed to be too caught up in personal grief to even notice me.”\n “Ah, good friends are friends forever,” the entity said, “mon capitaine.”\n “Q!” the other entity spoke, recalling at once that he was Jean-Luc Picard.  “What madness is this?  What have you gotten me into now?”\n In a flash, the blackness vanished and Q and Jean-Luc were standing on a hillside, the breeze blowing, the trees waving, the grass beneath them, and the sun shining high in the sky.  It reminded Jean-Luc of his home in France.  “What is this?” Picard demanded, finding that now he had a body, or at least a representation of what was his body.\n “You’re dead,” Q replied, “and your life is about to pass before your eyes, starting with your old stomping grounds.”  He yawned.  “I’m sure it will be as droll as you; wake me when it’s over.”\n “Dead?” Picard echoed.  He remembered being shot, Worf immediately firing upon the assassin, Beverly looking into his eyes during his last moments of life, floating up, seeing his body with Beverly over him along with the other people who had gathered to hear his address, and then he floated out of the ship. He floated out past the stars, into the blackness where he met Q.\n “Deader than a door nail,” Q replied.  “This is my first time dead, too.  You know, I was rather concerned at the start of it all.  I thought I was in human Hell, what with that horrible feeling of isolation and all, but I had no idea why your God would want to send me there, especially since I had done so much work to help His poor, pathetic people.  Then I saw you and I knew that I must be in Heaven.”  Q smiled warmly as he approached Jean-Luc and put his hand on Jean-Luc’s right shoulder.  “Just think, mon capitaine, an eternity together!”\n “You were right the first time,” Picard grumbled as he removed Q’s hand from his shoulder.  “This must be Hell.”\n Q rolled his eyes.  “For once you think you would show a little gratitude!  After all, I was trying to help you out!”\n “You can help me out by returning me to my ship!”\n “I am just as human as you, Picard,” Q replied dryly.  “Don’t you remember?  I came aboard your ship seeking to help you after the Continuum stripped me of my powers but you whined and put me in the brig then the Calamarain came.  They took me, tortured me, and left me for dead on some God forsaken moon.  After that, I was passed from race to race, species to species, being tortured not only for things I had done but also for things the other members of the Continuum had done.  I was actually relieved when the Taecate executed me.”\n “I hope you’re satisfied, Q,” Picard said irately.  “You always wanted to find out all you could about humans and now you get to find out about death.  I hope you’re learning something.”\n “None of this would have happened if you had been more cooperative when I came aboard your ship,” Q advised.\n “What do you mean?” Picard demanded.\n “I came aboard to help you, Picard,” Q stated.  “You know, a funny thing happened to me on my way to eternity-the Continuum showed me what things might have been like had I lived.  One thing that would have been different is that you would still exist in your limited existence in time.”\n “Q, I am not interested in…,” Picard began to say.\n “Oh, but you should be, mon capitaine,” Q replied.  “If I had lived, it would have meant that somebody from your crew was able to save me from the Calamarain and then the Continuum would have restored my powers.  I could have been there to save you from your assassin.”  Picard looked at Q with unbelief.  “Trust me.  That is the way it would have worked out.”\n “I’d rather see you dead and out of our way,” Picard said with a sardonic smile.  “I guess if I had to die as a result then that is a small price to pay.”\n “There you go again, Picard,” Q sighed.  “You do wound me.  I have only wanted to help you; I have always held your best interest in mind.”\n “Thank you for your concern, Q, but we can manage just fine without you,” Picard asserted.  “The last thing humanity needs is your superior attitude directing our lives!”\n “You know,” Q said nostalgically, “that is exactly what John F. Kennedy told me just before he decided to go on his joy ride through Dallas on November 22, 1963.  When he died, I was swimming in the waters of Orxim Theta.  Where were you?”\n “Q…,” Picard began irately.\n “Humanity has never appreciated me,” Q continued.  “I tried to tell Hitler that he could make it as an artist but do you think he listened?  Humph!  You and he have a lot in common, Picard.  I remember when…”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1, 7, "PER"], [10, 15, "PER"], [91, 105, "PER"], [118, 124, "PER"], [245, 253, "PER"], [268, 273, "PER"], [338, 344, "PER"], [420, 426, "PER"], [477, 481, "PER"], [490, 495, "PER"], [506, 512, "PER"], [552, 562, "LOC"], [566, 577, "LOC"], [609, 618, "LOC"], [621, 627, "PER"], [1144, 1157, "PER"], [1162, 1163, "PER"], [1220, 1235, "PER"], [1337, 1338, "PER"], [1343, 1351, "PER"], [1493, 1501, "PER"], [1517, 1523, "LOC"], [1542, 1548, "PER"], [1658, 1659, "PER"], [1846, 1852, "PER"], [1888, 1892, "PER"], [1931, 1938, "PER"], [2028, 2035, "PER"], [2211, 2212, "PER"], [2242, 2243, "PER"], [2623, 2624, "PER"], [2372, 2376, "LOC"], [2613, 2619, "LOC"], [2656, 2664, "PER"], [2685, 2695, "PER"], [2726, 2739, "PER"], [2798, 2804, "PER"], [2828, 2831, "PER"], [2871, 2875, "LOC"], [2879, 2880, "PER"], [3063, 3068, "SPEC"], [3077, 3083, "PER"], [3086, 3087, "PER"], [3262, 3272, "SPEC"], [3565, 3572, "SPEC"], [3614, 3615, "PER"], [3618, 3624, "PER"], [3691, 3697, "SPEC"], [3874, 3875, "PER"], [2366, 2371, "SPEC"], [3906, 3912, "PER"], [3952, 3958, "PER"], [3961, 3962, "PER"], [3180, 3189, "ORG"], [3511, 3520, "ORG"], [4038, 4047, "ORG"], [4214, 4215, "PER"], [4243, 4249, "PER"], [4289, 4302, "PER"], [4305, 4306, "PER"], [4412, 4422, "SPEC"], [4436, 4445, "ORG"], [4536, 4542, "PER"], [4553, 4554, "PER"], [4673, 4679, "PER"], [4804, 4810, "PER"], [4813, 4814, "PER"], [4953, 4954, "PER"], [4998, 5004, "PER"], [5108, 5109, "PER"], [5152, 5167, "PER"], [5229, 5235, "LOC"], [5305, 5316, "LOC"], [5338, 5339, "PER"], [5343, 5349, "PER"], [5367, 5375, "SPEC"], [5403, 5404, "PER"], [5434, 5440, "PER"], [5548, 5554, "PER"]]}
{"id": 629, "text": "PART 1\n Stardate 77372.14\n Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of his starship, the USS Lexington. He looked out at the gargantuan Borg vessel on the viewscreen. “Captain, the Borg seem unaware of our presence, but their scans are increasing” said his operations officer, “Maintain Grey-mode Protocol” he ordered. The ship was following the Borg Cube trying to divert it from its course to Earth. Starfleet was bogged down with the Borg in other sectors and even with help from the Klingons and Romulans, they were not making much headway. Planet after planet in system after system were falling to the Borg. a siren alerted at the tactical status, “Captain, we’ve been detected, Borg vessel altering course to an attack position” reported his tactical officer, “Full shields and weapons, fire” he ordered. The Borg vessel was faster as his crew bustled. The first shot was staggering. Explosions rocked the vessel, throwing the Captain to the floor. “Damage report” demanded the Captain, staggering to his feet, “Hull breach on deck 24, main power to 15%, secondary power and emergency back-ups are destroyed, weapons are offline, shields are at 27%, Sir” shouted his tactical officer, “Number 1” he shouted, mimicking an old mentor and role model. His first officer was dead under some debris. The ops officer shouted up, “Captain, what’s left of the sensors are detecting tachyon emissions “. The Captain ignored that and shouted, “Helm, all forward, lay in a collision course, Lieutenant, drop an emergency beacon with information about what happened here” he ordered to his bridge staff, “Bridge to Main Engineering, shunt all available power to the impulse engines on my mark” he said. He took a deep breath to calm himself, “Mark” he said, “Power shunted, Captain” said the Chief Engineer. “Helm, Engage” he said. The ship moved forward, disintegrating as it went, the computers warning system kicked in, “Warning, collision detected, impact in 30 seconds”. The Captain watched with resignation as the Borg ship completely filled the viewscreen. Just before impact he saw a bright light, then lost consciousness.\n Stardate 48905.72. USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Earth\n Captain Jean-Luc Picard sat face to face with Admiral Edward Robertson. Sat next to him was Commander William Riker. The Admiral was briefing the Enterprise command officers as to their mission, “Captain, you understand this mission is to be classified, news of the possible return of the Borg could destabilise the Quadrant. Given that previous Borg attacks have been targeted at humanity, it might give those hostile to Starfleet the excuse they have been looking for to launch assaults along the Federation Borders” said the Admiral, “Understood, Sir, shall we be on our way, time is critical if it is indeed the Borg” said Picard. The wizened Admiral nodded, “Very well, Captain, I pray that I’m wrong” said the Admiral. The Admiral stood, shaking hands with Picard and Riker before leaving the briefing room. Before Picard or Riker could say anything, Lieutenant Commander Data contacted them, “Data to Picard, Captain, internal sensors are reading massive tachyon and chronoton emissions on deck 4” he said. Picard and Riker looked at each other, “Are you sure, Mr Data” said Picard, “Quite certain, Captain, the emissions seem to be occurring in an area about the size of a humanoid male about 6 feet tall” said Data. “Very well, Mr Data, have a security detail meet me and Commander Riker on deck 4” said Picard, leaving the briefing room with Commander Riker close behind.\n 5 minutes later, Picard, Riker and the security forces sent by Data and Worf were at the area where the tachyons were concentrated. The corridor seemed normal. Nothing seemed out of place, “Picard to Data, we have arrived at the area you directed us to, but there doesn’t seem to be anything here” he said. There was slight interference when Data responded, “Captain, the emissions are concentrating into one area, you might see something in the next few minutes” said Data, through the interference. They did.\n As the emissions condensed and concentrated, a bright light filled the corridor. When it cleared enough for the crew to look, a man lay on the deck. His uniform wasn’t recognisable, but the insignia showed he was a Starfleet officer. “Medical scan” ordered Picard. He watched the medic scanning the new man, and looked at him with a comparative eye. Whereas his uniform was black all the way up to the shoulder with red on the shoulders and a blue collar showing with his four command pips, the strangers uniform was black up to the shoulder where the shoulder pads turned grey. The collar was red and Captain Picard noticed that he was looking at another Starfleet Captain. “He’s alive, Captain” said a Security Ensign, “Picard to Transporter Room Three, two to beam directly to sickbay” said the Captain. They both dissolved and left the Commander and the security team on the deck. “Picard to Riker, return to the bridge and set a course for Ceridian III, Warp 6” said the Captain as Doctor Beverley Crusher examined her patient. The Captain watched the bustle quietly as they worked to heal the man’s extensive injuries. Thirty minutes later, the medical team stepped away from the patient, “I’ve stabilized him for the moment, but he is very weak. The next hour should determine his rate of recovery” she said. The Captain pondered the situation, “Can you wake him” he asked. The Doctor looked at him again, “Yes, of course, but he will be very weak” she replied.\n Captain Mark Smith was slowly becoming aware of his surroundings. It took him a few seconds to realize that he shouldn’t be able to become aware of his surroundings at all. He tentatively opened his eyes and saw a face that he hadn’t seen in the 20 years since his death. Captain Jean-Luc Picard stood over him. This was impossible as the Captain had been dead for 20 years. “My name is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise” he said briskly, “I know who you are, Sir” said Smith weakly, “I’m Captain Mark Smith, USS Lexington” he said. Before the Captain could reply, Smith fed him the vital piece of information, “Captain, I grew up on this ship, I think I have travelled back in time” he said. Picard didn’t seem surprised, “Yes, we observed tachyon emissions around the time and place you were discovered. But who are you to have grown up aboard the Enterprise” said Picard. Smith sighed, “My dad was the Deputy Chief Engineer who was killed in an EPS explosion when I was eleven” said Smith, “Yes, Lieutenant Smith was killed a week ago, Mr LaForge is trying to find out exactly what caused the explosion. Counsellor Troi is working with, erm, you” said Picard. There was a moment of awkward silence between the Captains. “What’s the Stardate where you’re from” said Picard. Smith cleared his throat, “77371.95” he said. The Captain sighed, “What’s Starfleet doing 40 years from now” said Picard, genuinely interested, “Well, Sir, there is lots I can’t say because of the Temporal Prime Directive. I couldn’t tell you much about the next forty years. However, for the last two years in my time, the Federation has been plagued by the Borg. The USS Alaska monitored several temporal distortions around the badlands, and a number of them had Borg signatures. When the Borg started hitting Federation colonies, the temporal schisms became a low priority” said Smith. Picard looked at him, looking ever so slightly haunted at the mention of the Borg, “What were you doing when you ended up on the Enterprise” asked Picard. Smith wracked his brain, “I believe that we were following a Borg vessel when we were detected. My ship was heavily damaged so I ordered all power to be diverted to the impulse engines and lay in a collision course” said Smith. Picard responded instantly, “Captain, we are on a mission to investigate the sudden appearance of Borg vessels in the Ceridian System. There have been no Borg incursions since the Battle of Wolf 359, but a deep space sensor relay suddenly picked up about 20 signatures. The Enterprise has been sent to investigate” said Picard. Smith frowned, “What’s the precise Stardate, Sir” said Smith, “48905.72” replied Picard. Smith suddenly had all his fears confirmed, “Captain, my recollection of this Stardate is the Enterprise going to Starbase 384 for weapons system refits” said Smith. Picard looked at him, “Yes, but Admiral Robertson redirected us to investigate the readings from the deep space sensor array” said Picard, equally concerned. “It would appear that some event has changed the timelines, quite possibly starting with the Borg invasion in my time, leading to the destruction of my ship to my appearance aboard the Enterprise” said Smith.\n On the bridge Commander Riker was looking at the sensors with Data. “What could be causing these readings, Mr Data” said Riker. Data made a face that almost looked pensive, “The parameters do not conform to that of any known sub-space or temporal distortions currently on record, Sir” said Data. Riker considered his options, “Any theories” he said. Before data responded, Worf spoke up, “Commander, there is a Borg signature emanating from the distortion. A Gravimetric distortion extending from the main disturbance” he said. Before the commander could give an order, the ship was enveloped in the gravimetric disturbance. “Red alert, Captain Picard to the bridge” said Riker, “All engines, full reverse” he ordered. The ship shuddered violently as the helm officer carried out Riker’s orders, “Commander, engines are at full reverse, it’s not having any effect” said the helm officer.\n Down in sickbay, Captain Picard was deliberating with Captain Smith, “Captain, come with me” said Picard. The Captains left the sickbay and walked towards the bridge. “Picard to the Bridge, Number One, what’s the situation” said Picard. “We are caught in a gravimetric distortion expanding from a larger anomaly. Mr Worf has detected a Borg signature and Mr Data has no theories. Engines are at full reverse but it’s not having any effect” said Riker. Picard sighed, “Understood” he said.\n Riker was watching the situation evolve in front of him. “Bridge to LaForge, I need more power to the impulse drive” said Riker urgently as the ship shook more violently, “I’ll do what I can, Sir, but if we keep this up the manifolds will rupture and we’ll be dead in the water” said Commander LaForge. The turbolift doors hissed open and Captain Picard stepped out with the other Captain, Riker was aware of the ripple of unease at the stranger on the bridge. “Report, Commander” said Picard, “Sir our best indication is that a Borg vessel is about to emerge from the distortion, there are chronoton emissions emanating from the distortion” said Riker, he looked at the other Captain, “It’s possible that this distortion could also lead to your time, Sir” said Riker. Picard looked to Smith, “Suggestions” he said. Smith thought for a second. “Mr Data, can you display sensor readings or the distortion on the main viewer” said Smith. Data complied instantly and Smith studied the readings, “This looks like a Borg Transwarp conduit, but the readings are unusual. Commander Riker’s assessment is correct, Sir, this distortion could indeed lead to my time” said Smith. He walked over to Worf, “Commander, launch a photon torpedo at these coordinates , prime it to explode on arrival. The antimatter discharge may break the ship free, helm reduce power before the manifolds rupture” he said, walking back to Picard and Riker at the centre of the bridge. He looked at Picard, “Ready, Sir, that should free the Enterprise from the distortion field” he said. Picard nodded, “Mr Worf, fire torpedoes” said Picard. Worf nodded, “Firing, Captain”. The torpedo flew from the ship, exploding right on target, “Captain, gravimetric distortion is weakening” reported Data, “Helm full reverse” said Picard.\n As the Enterprise  reversed away from the distortion, a Borg vessel protruded from it. The vessel was enormous in size and scope. “Captain, engines are overtaxed from the effort of escaping the distortion, we must power down or the impulse manifolds will rupture” said the helm officer. Picard focused on the helm officer, “Warp Engines” he questioned. The helm officer checked, “No, Captain, the gravimetric disturbances are interfering with the warp bubble I can’t get it to stabilize” said the helm officer. Smith stepped in, “Ensign, is there a way to reduce the warp profile of the Enterprise” said Smith. The Ensign thought for a second, “Yes but we can’t do it from here” she said, “ there is a malfunction in the command relays, it will have to be done from Main Engineering” she said. Picard stood, tapping his communicator, “Picard to Engineering, Mr LaForge, find a way to lower the warp profile of the ship” he said. The Borg ship continued to emerge from the distortion when LaForge contacted them again, “LaForge to Bridge, warp profile should be concealed” said LaForge. The Borg vessel was fully out of the distortion and the distortion was dissipating. “Scan the vessel, Mr Data” said Picard. Data scanned the Borg ship. “It is larger than the Borg vessels we have encountered so far, but its structure is perfectly geometric. There is a large section of damage to the vessel, indicating that a starship similar in size to the Enterprise collided with the ship” said Data. A sound of anguish and pain came from Captain Smith. The crew looked at him, “Remember what I said, Captain. The last thing I remember before waking up on deck 4 was my ship being heavily damaged in a Borg attack as a Borg vessel headed for Earth. I rammed the Borg to try and destroy them. I failed” said Captain Smith, sinking to his knees. A beeping cut through the tension on the bridge, “Captain, we are being hailed” said Worf. Captain Smith still knelt on the bridge, head held in shame, Captain Picard stood and walked forwards. Before he could order the channel open Worf said, “We are being scanned, Sir”. Picard looked at the damaged vessel, “Open a channel” he said. The screen showed an image of a terrible creature. It looked like a woman, only it had tubes sticking out of the crown of its head. Captain Picard and Captain Smith recognised it as a Borg queen. Her face showed an expression that had she not been an emotionless cybernetic abomination would have been likened to imperious and smug. “Locutus” she said to Picard. Picard’s face stonewalled, “That is not my name” he said, “Why do you resist us, Locutus, you know what we are capable of” she said. The bridge was quiet as Captain Picard and the Borg queen faced off. “Lucky for you, Locutus, we are not interested in you today” said the Borg queen suddenly. “Then what do you want” demanded Picard, coldly. She almost smiled, “Captain Mark Smith” she said, the words carefully measured for maximum effect. Picard’s gaze swung toward Smith briefly, “And if we refuse” said Picard. The Borg queen didn’t answer straight away. After a couple of seconds she said, “Deck 14 is now overrun with drones. If you do not had us Mark Smith, they will force visual and audio imagery of the slow assimilation of your crew until you change your mind” she said. Before Picard could respond, Smith stood, rage filling his thoughts. “You want me? Fine. Prepare to receive me, but if you want an easy assimilation subject, no if you expect an easy assimilation target then prepare for the biggest resistance you have ever encountered” said Smith. Picard flashed him a steely glare. “You’re threats are irrelevant, you know I won’t sacrifice a member of my crew” said Picard. Smith shot Picard an equally steely glare, “With respect, Captain Picard, the lives of the crew aboard this ship are worth more than mine. I lost my ship and all my crew are dead, so I will do anything to protect this ship and this crew” said Smith. Before Picard could respond the Borg queen smiled, that same mechanic, mirthless smile. “Not all of your crew are dead, Captain” she said.\n To be continued…", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null,

{"id": 630, "text": "PART 2\n Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Captain Mark Smith stood at a critical turning point. The Borg had placed a demand for Captain Smith. Captain Picard knew that handing him over would only mean that the Borg would chase the Enterprise until they recaptured him. Picard also had a hostage situation on deck 14 where the malicious Borg queen had transported scores of drones aboard as leverage to get what they wanted. Picard was trying to maintain control of a hot-headed Captain Smith who wanted to rescue the remnants of his crew. “If you have my crew, show me” demanded Smith. The Borg queen didn’t respond, other than moving aside to show two drones holding a struggling figure of a woman in the same uniform as him. “Mark” came the struggled gasps of the woman. Again Captain Smith fell to his knees as he recognised Lieutenant Commander Alyssa Smith, his wife”. The Borg queen again stepped back into the picture, “Will you join us, Smith” asked the queen, knowing she had the Enterprise crew and Smith backed into a corner. Knowing the situation was beyond him, Smith looked to Picard, “Captain” he said, resigned and defeated. Picard looked to him, “I cannot allow you to leave this ship, the Borg will just come after us again regardless, but then again, I cannot expect you to abandon your crew” said Picard, “Sir, we can’t save them” said Smith, “The Enterprise is more important” he said. Riker exploded, “How can you abandon them to assimilation”. Smith glared at him, “I don’t do it easily, Commander, that’s my wife on the screen, but here and now I have a duty as a Starfleet officer” he said. He turned to the screen, “My love, I’m sorry” he said, head sinking, before turning his attention to the Borg queen, “Go to hell, you skinny mechanic bitch” he growled. The drone holding Lieutenant Commander Smith lifted its hand, injecting the nanites into her blood stream. She screamed, the pain unbearable as the Borg nanites began to alter her. Her scream was not long-lived. Soon only a shell of the former human remained. “Locutus, you will be ours again, Smith, you will make an excellent drone” said the queen, closing the channel. A sniffle escaped Smith.\n Worf was intently watching the sensors throughout the whole exchange, nothing had really changed until now, “Captain, Borg weapons systems charging” he said. Picard wasted no time, “Helm, Warp 4, engage” he shouted. The Enterprise leapt away to warp 4. “Captain, receiving a distress transmission from deck 14” said Worf. Picard stood up, “Are the Borg following us from Earth” he asked. Worf checked the sensors, “Yes, Captain, closing at warp 7” said Worf. “Increase to maximum warp” he said, “Lets lead them away from Earth, Mr Worf, scan deck 14, I want to know what’s going on down there” said Picard. Worf worked the sensors, “Captain, visual contact” said Worf. “On screen” said Picard. The corridor was dark, drones moved around assimilating crewmembers of the Enterprise. Picard and the Bridge crew watched in horror, “Survivors” asked Riker. “None, Commander, all either assimilated or in the process of being assimilated” said Worf. The bridge was silent, “Vent deck 14” ordered Picard. The crew rippled, “Captain” said Commander Riker, “Number one, venting deck 14 might spare the crew a living hell, I’m doing it to save the Enterprise” said Picard. Worf keyed in the command sequence, “Ready, Captain” he said, indicating that the deck was primed for venting. “Make it so, Commander” said Picard. Worf punched it in. “Venting complete, Captain” said Riker, “Nothing is alive down there” he finished.\n The Borg cube pursued the Enterprise relentlessly. The Borg queen was hell bent, if you could consider her hell bent, on capturing Locutus and Captain Smith. The Enterprise was going at maximum cruise speed. She watched as the Enterprise drew closer as the Borg ship was outrunning her. She could picture the resistance that Locutus and Smith would put up as they were assimilated into the Collective. If you could call what she felt pleasure, she had a pleasurable anticipation of the assimilation to come.\n Back on the Enterprise, Captain Picard watched the Borg ship closing in, “What is our current velocity” he asked. “Warp 9.2, Sir” reported Data, “Increase to Warp 9.8” said Picard. Smith stood up, “Captain, Warp 9.8 puts the Enterprise at extreme risk, especially given that the Borg are pursuing us” said Captain Smith. Picard looked over at him, “What are you suggesting, Mr Smith” he asked. “Mr Data, show me a map of the region” said Captain Smith. The map came up at Data’s station. “There, the Archanis Nebula, if we head there at Warp 9.6, we can be there in about 11 hours. With that Borg cube as badly damaged as it is, it is unlikely that they will be able to go much faster that Warp 9.6” said Smith. Picard nodded, “Make it so” he said, returning to the command chair.\n The Borg queen experienced something that could be likened to rage and frustration. The Enterprise had increased speed to Warp 9.6 and with the damage caused by the impact with the Lexington meant that the cube could not outpace the Enterprise. The only way they would out run the ship is if they carried on for more than 12 hours and had to drop out of warp. The entire collective consciousness of the Borg was focused on the Enterprise and little more.\n 10 hours 53 minutes 23 seconds later\n The Enterprise dropped out of warp and headed into the nebula. Commander Riker stood next to Data’s station, “Captain, this nebula has a high level of Particle Flux, we can’t stay in here long” he said. Picard nodded, “How long do we have, Number one” he said, gravely. Riker looked at the screen, “24 minutes, Captain”. “Take us to the edge of the nebula, Mr Worf, prepare a full spread of Photon torpedoes to fire straight into the damaged section of the Borg cube” said Captain Picard. “Aye, Sir” said Worf. The Enterprise moved out at half impulse, Worf ready to unleash the Enterprise’s weapons systems on the Borg ship. When they reached the edge of the Nebula, there was no Borg ship. “Full sensor scan” said Picard. Data performed the Scan, “Captain Smith, please have a look at this information” said Data. Smith had a look, “Captain, the Borg vessel has set a course for Starbase 245, it looks like it’s just approaching the edge of sensor range, so presume it’s moving at Warp 9.7” said Captain Smith. Picard looked shocked, “Bridge to Engineering, Geordi, what is the effect on the warp engines from our prolonged travel at warp 9.6” he said, “We have to keep power output of the warp engines to a minimum, Captain, I suggest you don’t push her faster than warp 7”  said Geordi LaForge. Picard turned to Data, “Mr Data, how soon could we be there at warp 7” he said, “2 hours 28 minutes 45 seconds, Sir” said Data, “Helm, lay in a pursuit course, Engage” said Picard.\n Starbase 245\n Commodore Andre Heston was the base commander of Starbase 245. It was a quiet assignment as Starfleet had always routed invading forces before they approached the base. Today however, they were watching the sensors as they showed a Borg vessel approaching at high warp with no Federation Starships to route it. The Commodore watched as the crew bustled to the final preparations, making sure the weapons and shields were active. “Sir, Borg vessel arrival in 2 minutes” said an officer. This was it, the battle was afoot and there was nothing anyone could do about it. Moments later, the gargantuan cube dropped out of warp. Without warning it savagely attacked the Starbase. Within moments officers were reporting shield failures and hull breaches. After a meagre 7 minutes, the station was little more than a debris field. The Borg cube silently moved off, hoping to lure the Enterprise towards them.\n 2 hours 21 minutes later\n The USS Enterprise dropped out of warp 50000 kilometres away from the debris field that was Starbase 245. “My God” said Captain Smith looking at the devastation left in the wake of the Borg. “Captain, the Borg are trying to lure us into a trap. Judging by the continuing trail away from this site, it is the only conceivable solution”. Riker thought hard, “We need reinforcements, Captain, but we can’t take the Enterprise back into Federation space. The Borg would just follow” he said. “Mr Worf, what is the nearest Starship to our location” he said. Worf checked, “The Galaxy, Sir” he responded. “Open a channel” he ordered. Within seconds, the face of Captain Alex Bertrum was on the screen, “Captain Picard, how can we help you” he said, “We need to get an officer back to Earth to brief the Council about a Borg invasion. But I can’t take the Enterprise back in to Federation Space, could you rendezvous with us” asked Picard, “Certainly, Captain, set a course to meet us and we will do the same, rendezvous in 3 hours, Galaxy out”  said Captain Bertrum. “Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at warp 6” said Picard, “All senior officers, report to the bridge” said Riker.\n Picard, Riker, Data and Worf walked into the observation lounge. Picard took the seat at the head of the table and waited, the tension palpable between the officers. Moments later, Doctor “Commander” Beverley Crusher, Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge and Councillor “Lieutenant Commander” Deanna Troi walked into the briefing room. When they were all seated. “For those who haven’t met our new crewmate, this is Captain Mark Smith. He commands the Federation Starship Lexington about 30 years from now and was only sent back when he intersected with a temporal distortion” said Picard, introducing Smith. There was a ripple of recognition as they all recognised the 41 year old version of the boy who still regularly saw Councillor Troi and Doctor Crusher. “Good Morning” said Smith, formally to the people who had helped raise him to what he was. “As you know the Borg are trying to lure this ship into a trap in an attempt to acquire Captain Smith and myself, so we can’t fly back to Earth, without bringing the Borg down on us. So we are setting a course to rendezvous with the USS Galaxy. I will go aboard the Galaxy and we will head back to Earth at maximum warp. Commander Riker and Captain Smith will assume control of the ship, with Captain Smith leading the Borg away” said Picard. Picard turned to Smith, inviting him to talk, “I know it won’t be easy, taking orders from someone you perceive to be a small boy, but I promise you, I will do everything I can to keep this ship safe. I would welcome any suggestions you might have while I’m in Command” said Smith. Picard turned back to the crew, “We rendezvous with the Galaxy in 3 hours, Captain Smith please stay, the rest of you return to your duties” he said. Captain Smith remained seated alongside Captain Picard. “Captain, what I’m about to do is dangerous. When I was assimilated by the Borg, they assimilated my thought patterns and its possible that wherever they are they know what I’m planning, or at least they can guess” he said. He looked distant for a moment, and Smith knew what pressure this was putting on the Captain. “I’m going to send a report to the Admiralty explaining who you are, but I’m going to classify it top secret, so you will have to get into a Starfleet uniform like what the crew wears. I also would like you to keep a sensor lock on the USS Galaxy for as long as you can in case the Borg attack. Are you prepared to command my ship, Captain” said Picard, “Aye, Sir” said Smith, “Computer, transfer all command functions to Captain Smith, authorization Picard Alpha Tango” said Picard. “There is no Authorization for Captain Smith, please enter the relevant information” said the computer. “Computer, enter authorization code Smith Zulu five” said Smith, “Register information under Captain Mark Smith” said Smith. “Command functions transferred to Captain Mark Smith” said the cool voice of the computer. “The Enterprise is now your ship, Captain” said Picard. Smith smiled sadly, “The Enterprise will always be your ship, Captain, I will just be another chapter in hers and your story, Sir” said Captain Smith.\n 3 hours later\n The USS Galaxy was holding position just off the starboard bow awaiting Captain Picard’s arrival. “Smith to Transporter room two, is Captain Picard ready to disembark” he said, “Yes, Sir, just waiting for confirmation from the Galaxy, Sir” replied Miles O’Brien. Smith settled into his chair and his new uniform. “As soon as you have confirmation from the Galaxy, beam Captain Picard over” he said, “Yes, Sir” said O’Brien.\n Captain Smith was somewhat uncomfortable. The universe was in a state of temporal flux that none could predict and he and Captain Picard were now right at the centre of things. A single mistake could result in the destruction of the Enterprise, writing the rest of history for the Federation in a completely different manner, it could even destroy the Federation. As the report came in that Captain Picard had been transported to the other ship, Smith ordered that a wide band covariant signal be transmitted on all frequencies and that the ship move away at warp 6. As far as all intelligence aboard the Enterprise, only one Borg vessel had been reported, so that meant they had to keep it busy until Picard could muster the fleet to destroy it.  “Captain, Borg vessel approaching from heading 232 mark 4” said Worf, his deep voice rumbling across the bridge, “Hold your course, Mr Evans” ordered Smith as the crew rippled with unease. “Mr Worf, Report” he said  turning to look at his tactical officer. Worf checked the sensors, “Borg vessel is approaching at warp 9.1 , visual contact in ten seconds, its weapons are fully charged” said Worf. Smith sighed, “On Screen” he said. The image showed a Borg vessel, but it looked to be too small to be a Borg cube. “Magnify” he said. The magnified image showed a Borg sphere, “Damn” shouted Smith, “Mr Evans, drop out of warp, Mr Data, contact the Galaxy, warn them that they might be at risk of attack” said Smith. “Time to intercept, 1 minute, 24 seconds”  said Worf. “Red Alert, all hands to battle stations” said Riker. “Captain, I am unable to raise communications with the Galaxy” said Data. “Sensors show a second Borg signal on an intercept course with the Galaxy” said Worf, as the Borg sphere dropped out of warp. “Mr Worf, fire a full spread of photons and phasers at a concentrated section of that vessel” he said, “Helm, lay in an intercept course for the USS Galaxy, maximum warp” he said. He watched dispassionately as Worf’s barrage of weapon fire slammed into the Borg vessel, ripping it apart. “Helm, the USS Galaxy, engage” he said, urgency gripping him.\n The Enterprise jumped to warp. “ETA on the Galaxy” he said, “12 minutes, Captain” said the helm officer, “Maintain course and speed” he said, “Senior officers, report to the bridge” said Smith. He turned to Commander Riker, “Mr Riker, when we complete this briefing, I want  you and Mr Worf to prepare a fully armed security detail and lead it over to the Galaxy if I see fit” said Smith. “Aye, Sir are you expecting trouble” said Riker, “Yes, Commander” he turned to Councillor Troi, “Councillor, what do you imagine the news of an imminent threat to the Federation would do to the crew” he said, “ Panic them, and if we are wrong, it would cause resent and the crew would be bristling under your command” said Troi. Smith sighed, “Options, we are facing a real and present danger from the Borg and I cannot in good consciousness keep them in the dark” he said. Smith wished he had Picard’s wisdom in this situation, “We are informing the crew, I’ll address them at the proper moment” he said as the bridge turbolift doors hissed open and the senior officers stepped out. “This is a critical briefing, it will be given to all hands, open internal communications link” he said. He sighed, “All hands this is the bridge, there is an extreme risk to the Federation. We just lost contact with the USS Galaxy which Captain Picard transferred to in order to warn Earth of the impending Borg attack. We have reason to believe that the Galaxy is under attack from a Borg cube and are therefore setting a course to intercept, I want all stations battle ready in 4 minutes” he said, closing the internal comms. “I need to options. The Enterprise may be out matched by the Borg and I need ways to keep her in the fight. Mr LaForge, Mr Data, work on a way of increasing shields and weapons to compensate for the adaptive nature of the Borg, Commander Riker, Mr Worf, I need tactical strategies in place. Captain Picard may still be in a position where we can rescue him and so we must try to do so. The future of the Federation may depend on it” he said, “Doctor Crusher, Captain Picard may be injured if we can retrieve him, and the battle may cause injuries across the ship, I want your medical teams on full standby” he said as Doctor Crusher nodded her assent. “Councillor Troi, I need you to remain on the bridge, with the rest of the senior staff off the bridge, I’ll need you to act as my first officer” he said, Troi looked worried, but accepted his orders, “Captain, we are approaching the USS Galaxy I’m not reading any Borg vessels” said the Helmsman, “Slow to 1/3” he said. “Mr Worf, open a channel, we shouldn’t have met the Galaxy so soon” he said. Turning his attention to the Galaxy, he said “Enterprise to Galaxy”. There was no response, “Enterprise to Galaxy, please respond” still nothing, “Mr Worf, intensive scan” he said. Worf scanned the Galaxy, “Nothing out of the ordinary, Captain”. Then the first shot came. “Captain, we are being hailed” said Worf, “On screen” shouted Captain Smith.\n The Borg queen observed the crew of the USS Enterprise with an almost excited disposition. She knew that they would be demoralized when they saw her, and even more demoralized to see who accompanied her and what she had done to him.  It pleased her to have so many new ‘children’ in her fold. “You, what the hell are you playing at” said Captain Smith. “Perfecting the galaxy” replied the queen cryptically. “Where is Captain Picard” demanded Smith.\n The bridge crew of the Enterprise were bristling at the appearance of the Borg queen on the USS Galaxy. The Borg queen hadn’t responded to Captain Smith’s question as to the whereabouts of Captain Picard. Suddenly she stepped aside.

{"id": 631, "text": "PART 3\n Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of the USS Enterprise looking at her former Captain. “Resistance is futile, lower your shields and surrender your ship. Your culture will adapt to service us” said Locutus, formerly Captain Picard, “No, we will not surrender, Locutus, you were taken from the Borg by this crew and restored to Captain Picard before” said Captain Smith. “The unit Picard is part of us, he cannot be removed” said Locutus, “Surrender is the only option” he said. Smith sighed, “Commander, prepare boarding parties to recover Captain Picard” he said, “Mr Worf, go with him” he said. Ensign Macaulay stepped up to replace Worf, “Ensign, target the Galaxy shields, Mr Data, do whatever you have to, to keep the Enterprise a step ahead of the Borg” he said. Weapons fire from the Galaxy hit the Enterprise first. The power of the shots quickly overwhelmed the defences, “Damage report” shouted Captain Smith. “Main power is offline” shouted Ensign Macaulay, “Shields and Weapons are inoperative, hull integrity down to 74%” shouted Data. “Helm, reverse course, full impulse” shouted Smith, “Manifolds can’t handle full impulse, Captain” shouted the helm officer. “Commander LaForge” shouted Smith, “I’ll be in Engineering” replied LaForge.\n Commander Riker was regaining his feet, “Riker to Bridge, what’s happening” said Riker, tapping his commbadge, “The Galaxy is attacking, we are taking heavy damage. I’m sorry, Commander, we have to pull back and focus on rescuing Captain Picard another time” said Smith, “Understood, Captain” said Riker. He steadied himself against another shot, “Mr Worf, what are the odds that the Borg try to board the ship” asked Riker, “High, Sir, the Borg only live to assimilate, it is their way” he said, “Take a security detachment and secure main engineering. I’ll take the rest and secure other key areas of the ship” said Riker, “Aye, Commander replied Worf. The officers walked in separate directions leading security detachments across the ship. As they went another volley of shots crippled secondary power, “Right, we won’t make it to the bridge, I suggest we head to sickbay and help Doctor Crusher keep the wounded alive and safe” said Riker.\n The bridge lights exploded, “Captain, impulse engines are offline” shouted Data, “I’ve lost helm control” shouted the Helm officer, “Secondary power systems are offline” shouted the stand-in tactical officer. The assault stopped, “Captain, incoming message from the Galaxy, audio only” reported Ensign Macaulay. “Let’s have it” demanded Captain Smith. “Witness the beginning, resistance is futile” said the voice of Locutus.\n Stardate 48922.81, Starfleet Headquarters, San Francisco\n Vice Admiral John Adamson was looking at the report given to him by Captain Michael Thornton, Commanding Officer of the USS Akira. “Captain, I want an account of everything” said the Admiral, “Sir, about 4 hours ago, we lost contact with the Starships Enterprise and Galaxy. Our sensors picked up massive amounts of weapons fire as well as Borg signatures. When everything died down, we detected a starship but we could not open a line of communication. Intensive scans showed it to be the Enterprise, she was maintaining position when we moved back to transmission range. Admiral, we are the only other starship within 4 days of the Enterprise, if the Borg are gathering forces in this area, we need more ships” said Captain Thornton. “Understood, Captain, you are to hold your position on the edge of the sector until reinforcements arrive. Monitor the Neutral Zone for any signs of the Romulans taking advantage of the weakened state of the Enterprise, Adamson Out” he said. He turned away from the viewscreen feeling uneasy. As the head of Fleet operations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard had filed a report about Captain Smith, and the position Picard was assigning him. With the Galaxy and Picard MIA and a heavy Borg presence being noted, along with the destruction of Starbase 245, the Admiral was becoming concerned with the security of the Federation.\n “Damn it, we were attacked 4 hours ago, Locutus could be anywhere by now and we have no way of contacting Starfleet” snapped Captain Smith, in what was left of Starboard observation. “Mr LaForge, status of the Engines” he said, “We think we have thrusters back, Captain, we need to test them before we can bring Impulse and Warp power back online” he said. He nodded, his temper subsiding slightly. “Mr Data, how are the sensors” he said, “We can only use short range sensors at the present time. All long range sensors have been destroyed” he said. Smith’s head dropped, “Find a way to reroute long range sensors through the short range sensor arrays, then transfer all power from the long range arrays back into shields and weapons. Mr LaForge, assist Mr Data when we are sure about the status of the Engines” he said. Riker pitched in, “Captain, Doctor Crusher is requesting that anyone with a level 2 medical qualification assist her teams in triage” he said. “Give her all the help she needs” ordered Smith. He turned his attention to Worf, “What about weapons” he said, “The phasers are being repaired as we speak. The torpedo firing system is online” he said. Smith sighed, “Very well, dismissed, prepare for engine trials” he said, joining the officers as they stepped onto the bridge. “Helm, forward thrusters to 50%, port and starboard at station keeping” he said. The thrusters activated, seemingly without fault, “LaForge to Bridge, Captain, the thrusters repairs are complete, I can give you partial impulse in 10 minutes and partial warp in 15 minutes”  said LaForge. Exhausted with the fatigue of defeat, Captain Smith turned to Councillor Troi, the most senior officer on the bridge at that time, “Councillor, you have the bridge, alert me if we run across the Galaxy” he said, walking into his ready room as Councillor Troi sat in the command chair.\n After a few hours of restlessness, he was thrown to the floor as an explosion rocked the ship. “Report” he said. Walking out onto the bridge, “Romulans” was the only reply, “Open a channel” ordered Smith. The stand in tactical officer was doing so, “No response, Captain”. Smith pondered, in his time, the Romulans were allies, he even had Romulan friends, but where he was now, they would attack and they would not consider being friends. They wanted a ship like the Enterprise.  “Back us off, use thrusters and impulse engines to get us inside that proto-stellar nebula” ordered Smith. “Captain, if we go in there, we will be cornered, if the Romulans leave, the Borg will just take their place” said Ensign Macaulay. “Agreed, very well, Ensign, helm go to warp 1 and get us away from Romulan space” ordered the Captain.\n The Enterprise repairs were going well, after 15 hours, weapons and shields were at 94% while Data and LaForge had managed to enhance the short range sensor arrays with long range equipment. Impulse engines had been fully repaired and Commander LaForge was preparing to unlock the magnetic constrictors and allow the full use of the warp drive. Commander Riker had returned to the bridge, but he had left security details at main engineering and sickbay ready for any Borg incursions. They were both sat in their chairs at the centre of the bridge. “Captain, our long range sensors have picked up unusual readings, I went to Stellar Cartography and ran a Quantum Spectral Analysis. The signatures are Borg, in about 3 days, the Viridian and Ceridian systems will be overwhelmed” said Riker, “I contacted Starfleet and forwarded the date I had, they are marshalling all ships to Sector 221 to engage, but I also found the Galaxy” he said. Smith looked at Riker, “Where is she” he said. Riker pulled up the data on a PADD. “The Goren sector, approaching Earth at maximum warp, accompanied by 2 Borg scout-ships” said Riker with a sigh. Smith looked at the data, “What’s their ETA” he said quietly. Riker looked at the information, “20 days 4 hours at maximum warp, Sir” said Riker. He stood slowly, “Captain, we have also been hailed by Admiral Rogers, we have been ordered to meet with the fleet at the edge of Sector 221” reported Data, “I can’t get a stable communications line due to interference from a plasma storm in that area” he reported. “Helm, lay in an intercept course for the Galaxy, warp 4.8” ordered Smith. The helm officer shot a look at Data, “Course plotted, Captain” reported the officer. “Engage” replied Smith, “Red alert” he finished, “Commander, I apologize, but hopefully this is an opportunity to rescue Captain Picard before he is destroyed. The timeline relies on it, so disregard any and all Starfleet Protocols. Submit the situation in your report” he said. Turning to the helm officer he said, “Ensign, ETA on the Galaxy”. The helm officer looked back, “At this speed 15 hours, but if we can get to maximum warp, I can do that in less than 4 hours” she said. Smith nodded, “Smith to LaForge” he said, tapping his communicator. “LaForge here” replied Lieutenant Commander LaForge. “Commander, can you have the constrictors unlocked in 1 hour” he asked, “Yes, Captain, I’m just finishing the preparation procedure, it’ll be done in about 20 minutes” reported LaForge. “Acknowledged” he said.\n Meanwhile, on Earth, “Admiral, we have just got a long range sensor report from the USS Rhode Island. We are seeing a ship that appears to be the USS Galaxy as well as the USS Enterprise” reported a Vulcan Commander. Admiral Robertson looked at the report, “What is the heading of the Galaxy” he asked. “They are on a direct course for sector 001, the Enterprise is on an intercept course” reported the Commander, “Get me the Enterprise” ordered the Admiral. Minutes later, the Enterprise bridge was on his monitor. “Admiral, what’s the situation” asked Commander Riker. “Where is Captain Smith” he said, remembering the report of Picard and the Galaxy crew being assimilated. “On his way, Admiral” replied Riker. “Commander, what the hell is going on” said Admiral Robertson. “The Galaxy is making a direct run at Sector 001 while the fleet is engaged at Sector 221. They have Borg escorts, we are pursuing in the hopes of recovering Captain Picard, the future of the Federation may depend on it” said Riker. “Do you require assistance, I can have ships meet you in 3 days” said the Admiral, “Not necessary, Admiral, the fleet will be needed where they are”. The Admiral nodded, “Robertson Out” he said.\n An hour later, the Enterprise was travelling at Warp 9.6 in an attempt to intercept the Galaxy and Captain Picard. The ship was only 2 and a half hours out travelling at current speeds. “I want shields set to rotating harmonics, weapons set to high-end EM frequencies, prepare anti-matter spreads to confuse their sensors. All emergency and secondary power to shields, reduce lighting in all areas of the ship to 15% and divert that energy to the weapons” ordered Captain Smith. “Reduce all non essential systems to minimal requirements and hold that energy in reserve” ordered Riker.\n 2 hours later\n The darkened bridge was comforting for Captain Smith. He was used to the bridge dimming at red alert to divert power to the weapons and shields, it felt like normal to have a darkened bridge again. “Captain, the Galaxy has altered course to intercept but its escorts are continuing on course to Sector 001” reported Worf. “What’s the Galaxy’s new course” asked Smith, “334 Mk 114, an intercept course” he reported. “Entering visual range” said Data, “On screen” ordered Riker. The Galaxy looked different. Borg devices were appearing on the hull, the nacelles were glowing green rather than blue. The ship was a Borg ship all over. “Time to intercept 2 minutes 14 seconds” reported the helm officer. Smith and Riker shared a glance, “Battle Stations” they said, in unison.\n The bridge was silent with anticipation, “Slow to half impulse” ordered Smith, “Ready phasers, load photon torpedoes” he continued. “Captain, the Galaxy is dropping out of warp 5000 km dead ahead” said Worf. Data was looking at the sensors, “Captain, I’m reading an increase of protons emanating from the Galaxy deflector dish” reported Data. “Proton emissions” questioned the Captain, confused. A sudden realisation hit him, “Rotate shield harmonics to compensate for Proton bursts” shouted the Captain as the first burst slammed the ship, “sparks erupted and the ship shook heavily, “Shield rotations having no effect” shouted Worf, “5 EPS conduits ruptured in Engineering, they have massive casualties” shouted another officer. “Smith to Engineering, Commander, I need a way to block these proton bursts” shouted Smith, “I got nothing, Captain, they are disrupting power systems, I’ll get back to you” said LaForge, “Brace for impact” shouted Worf as another burst hit the ship. The crew were again thrown to the floor, “Captain, shields are completely ineffective” shouted Worf, “No activity in the main weapons array on their ship, or ours” shouted Worf, “Helm, move us away” ordered Smith, “Aye, Sir” shouted the helm officer. “LaForge to Bridge, we have a new problem, you need to stop using the impulse engines, we’re burning Deuterium down here, were gunna blow our nacelles up, we won’t need any help from the Borg” came the shout of Commander LaForge. He considered, “Hold her together. I’ll reduce speed to ¾” said Captain Smith. Another burst slammed the ship, “Captain, starboard nacelle is fused, there is a plasma leak in that nacelle” reported the helm officer. Another burst slammed the ship, “Captain, weapon interlocks destroyed, primary and secondary systems destroyed” shouted Worf. “Reinforcing the structural integrity grid may buy time” said Data. “Make it so, Commander” shouted. “Bridge, this is Ensign Johnny Saunders, I need a clear evacuation rout for the children. There are 34 families on board presently and I have about 40 kids here” came an urgent call. Knowing that he had a younger version of himself aboard he knew he had to save the kids, “Commander Riker, you have the bridge, I need to get them kids” he said. “Yes, Captain” said Riker, in no mood to argue as another shot slammed the ship. Captain Smith grabbed a phaser, as he left the bridge he heard Worf shout, “Commander, Shield power relays taking heavy damage, Internal sensors are failing, but showing 20 Borg on every deck below deck 10, you won’t make it to deck 20, that’s where Ensign Saunders’ signal came from” he said addressing the Captain. “I intend to try, Commander, transmit orders for ALL crewmen to arm up” he said. “Aye, Captain” said Riker. Just as he prepared to enter the turbolift a burst slammed the ship. “Captain, Main power offline, not enough secondary for turbolift operation” shouted Worf. The Captain instantly went to the Jeffries tubes, “Commander, seal the bridge when I pass the bulkhead” he ordered. Riker simply nodded.\n 5 minutes later, Captain Smith hit a blockage in the tube at deck 6. He kicked through a damaged panel. “Smith to Bridge, Commander, I’m running deck to deck on foot” he said, tapping his communicator. “Copy that, Captain, the Galaxy is holding position. No more activity” reported Riker. “Acknowledged, reinforce structural integrity grid and polarize the hull, divert power from shields and weapons if you have to, cut impulse engines” he ordered. “Aye, Captain” said Riker, “Smith Out” said the Captain.\n After another 5 minutes Smith was on Deck 14. He had climbed into a turbolift shaft and made a rudimentary rappel and fast roped down to the turbolift that was on deck 14. As he forced the door. He saw Borg working on the Enterprise and her crew. “Smith to Saunders, I’m on deck 14, ETA 5 minutes, Smith Out” he said. He holstered his Phaser, he didn’t want to provoke the Borg. He was looking for another access point. He wanted to jump the last 6 decks like had jumped to deck 14. He found it. As soon as he forced the door, the Borg turned towards him. He jumped down again and the door shut behind him. “Smith to Saunders, I’m on the deck, which section are you on” he said. “Head to section 3, Sir, Saunders out”, the Captain moved on. Soon he was in section 3. He forced the door and stepped into a phaser in the face. “Easy there, Ensign” said Smith. Another proton burst slammed the Enterprise followed by another 2. Smith sealed the door as the corridor outside the room collapsed.\n On the bridge, Worf picked himself up, looking at the rest of the bridge crew. “Report” said Riker. “Last internal scan showed a collapse in section 3 of Deck 20. There are 900 micro-fractures in the hull and 14 hull breaches, the Borg have repaired long range sensors and routed the Long range sensor data and all stellar cartography data with full detail as to all ships in Starfleet, the Borg fleet and the Klingon fleet to the bridge. Communications are down, weapons and shields are inoperative. Main power is offline, secondary power is at 23% and is barely sustaining life support” reported Worf. Riker looked around, “Shut down all lighting except alert lighting and divert the power to the life support systems” ordered Riker, “Get repair teams on those micro-fractures and have Geordi work on getting sub-space communications back” said Riker. “Display data being given by the Borg” said Riker.\n They were not aware of how the Borg were working such an angle. “Mr Data, how could the Borg go from emotionless to working an emotionally motivated attack. They have a concept of morale and human emotions, they are wearing our morale down” said Riker, “I do not know, Commander”. Riker sighed, “Ok, what are we looking at Data” said Riker. Data looked at the data, “500 ships are at the edge of the Viridian system trying box in a Borg invasion force. There are 42 anomalies open in the Viridian System. Starfleet is overwhelmed, Commander” reported Data. The bridge crew watched the dots moving around on the screen, each signifying hundreds, even thousands of lives desperately fighting for their lives. The only sound to pierce the silence of the smashed bridge of the Enterprise, was the crackling of flames, and the explosion of sparks from damaged consoles.\n To Be Continued….", "meta": {},

{"id": 632, "text": "PART 4\n Commander William Riker watched the battle unfolding on the battered bridge of the Enterprise. “Begin repairs, we need to find the Captain and get out of here” he said. Captain Smith had ran off to rescue a group of children trapped when the Borg boarded the ship. The Borg, supremely confident in their ability only sent 20 Borg per deck below deck 10. The Captain was trapped down there now as well. Riker looked to Data, “Mr Data, you have the bridge, what’s left of it anyway” he said, walking into the ready room. There was a morbid atmosphere on the bridge, they had just been watching the defeat of a combined force of 100 ships, Federation and Klingon, and been slammed out of the fight by the USS Galaxy, a former Federation vessel now commanded by the assimilated former Captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard. Riker sighed and picked up a chair in the ready room, returning it to its rightful place behind the desk.\n On deck 20, Captain Mark Smith sat slumped against a wall in the room where he had rushed to try and save the children trapped down there. All he felt was a profound sense of failure. When he had arrived in this time and learned that the Borg were breaking through, he set himself against the Borg, vowing to save the Federation and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant the same pain they were going through in his time. But through his efforts, Captain Picard had been re-assimilated by the Borg, the entire crew of the USS Galaxy had shared the same fate. The fleet had been engaged in battle with hundreds of Borg vessels in the Viridian system, and he had no idea what had happened to them. The Ensign who had sent the distress call in the first place was scanning the door that the Captain had sealed, “Captain, the Borg are leaving the door for the moment. Orders” he said. “Get some rest, Ensign, to get out of here, we are gunna need it” he said. The Ensign nodded and went over to the wall by the door and sat down, exhausted. The Captain went back to self pity, knowing it was useless, but at that particular moment he didn’t care. A small boy interrupted his train of thought, “Hi” said the boy nervously. In the dark Smith couldn’t see who it was, “Well hi there, kid” smiled the Captain, instantly hiding his true feelings, “You ok” he asked looking at the boy, “No, I’m scared” replied the child. The Captain looked at the boy, “What’s your name son” he said gently, “Mark” replied the child solemnly. Realization hit the Captain, “Mark Smith” he said, “Yes” said the younger version of himself, “What’s your name” asked the boy curiously, “Captain Mark Smith” replied the Captain. “Wow, you have the same name as me” said the boy, “Actually, I am you” said the Captain, ignoring the temporal prime directive. The young Mark Smith was confused, “Me” he said, “Yes, kid, I’m you from the future, so why are you scared” he asked. “The Borg” replied the child with a shiver. “Well they are very scary” agreed Captain Smith, gently patting the floor next to him. The child sat down, “They want to get us” said the child sadly. The Captain looked at him, “Yes” he said, “They want to get us”. The boy looked at him, eyes full of fear, “Will they” he asked. The Captain looked down on him, softly, “No, they will not get us if I can help it” said the Captain, “But to make sure they don’t get us, I need your help” he said, smiling, “I need you to be my brave little officer” said the Captain, smiling at all the children who had gathered around him. “All of you can be my brave little officers” he said. Looking around, he could see they were not convinced. “Here we go” said the Captain, reaching up to his collar and removing a pip, “Mark, I’m going to need a first officer” he said, putting the pip on the boys collar. “You there, what’s your name” said the Captain. “Alex” said the child. Smith smiled, “The Klingons would say that is a strong name, how would you like to be my security officer” he smiled. The child laughed softly, momentarily forgetting his fear, Ensign Saunders watched, laughing softly as well. Captain Smith clipped the second pip to the second young boy. He looked around, searchingly, “Who is good at science” he said. A couple of children put their hands up, “Ok, you” he said closing his eyes and pointing. A boy of about 12 stepped forward, “You are my new science officer” he said putting the third pip on the boys collar. Now I need to give a last pip, but what should they be an officer of, thought the Captain. Then he got it, “Now, who has the best eyesight” asked the Captain. All the kids pointed at a boy in the middle, “What’s your name, boy” asked the Captain, kindly. “John” said the boy, “I name you, Chief look out” smiled the Captain, giving the last of his pips away. He looked at the remaining kids, “Now, the rest of you have a job just as important as the others” he said, “I need you all to be the eyes and ears for me and Ensign Saunders” he said, “Can you do that” he said, smiling, “Yeah” said the children. The Captain laughed, “Right, bedtime then, a crew need s a good sleep before a mission” said the Captain. Within minutes, the children were all asleep, and Captain Smith and Ensign Saunders were agreeing on a watch rota to make sure the Borg didn’t catch them by surprise.\n After the group had slept for a long time to get their strength up, the Captain was ready to start his push to evacuate the children. He tested internal communications, tapping his communicator, “Smith to Bridge, is anyone there” said the Captain, “Captain, we had no idea you made it, internal communications failed shortly after your last conversation with Ensign Saunders” said an elated Commander Riker. The Captain smiled, in such a short time he had earned the respect of the crew, “Commander, are the turbolifts working yet, I need to get the children off the decks where the Borg are” he said, “Yes, Captain, turbolifts are operational again” replied Riker. “What about transporters” he asked, “They should be repaired soon, we have internal sensors back so I can keep a lock on you and if the transporters come online I can beam you out” said Commander Riker, “Acknowledged, Smith out” said the Captain.\n 10 minutes later, the scared group silently crept through deck 20, looking for the turbolift. They found themselves at a corridor with a turbolift at the end, “Ensign” whispered the Captain, “Take them to the turbolift, I’ll hold at this position until you are all in” he whispered, as the Ensign crept up beside him, “Yes, Sir” said the Ensign, ushering the children along the corridor. That’s when things started going wrong, Borg came out of nowhere from either side of the corridor section. He fired his phaser at them, taking a couple down, but they were quick to adapt, he smoothly changed the setting and fired again. He heard a shout behind him, “Captain, come on” shouted Ensign Saunders. The Captain turned and ran. As he ran past a door, it hissed open and a strong vice-like hand grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. Saunders began to leave the lift, “Get back, Ensign” shouted the Captain, struggling with the drone. He turned and punched it in the face. As he struggled with the first drone, he didn’t notice the second drone come out of another door, until it grabbed him, “Get out of here, that’s an order” shouted the Captain, as Borg swarmed towards the lift. The last sight they got of the Captain was him struggling in the grip of 2 drones, with about 40 drones rushing towards them. As the lift smoothly ascended Saunders tapped his communicator.\n On the bridge, Commander Riker was monitoring the repair efforts, when the call came through, “Saunders to bridge” he said, “Riker here” replied the Commander, “Sir, we are in the lift, the children are safe. I regret to inform you, Captain Smith was apprehended by the Borg” said the Ensign, “Understood, Ensign, Riker out”. The crew looked extremely demoralized, “Commander we are being hailed” said Worf, “On Screen” said Riker. “We have your Captain, lower your shields and surrender your ship, you will adapt to service us” said the Borg queen. Riker saw drones dragging Smith onto the assimilated bridge of the Galaxy, “Don’t surrender, Commander, that’s an order” he shouted. “Acknowledged, Captain. Don’t you surrender either, Sir” said Riker. “Acknowledged” said the Captain. The queen smiled, “Why do you resist us, we only want to help you achieve perfection” she said, almost petulantly, “I happen to like myself just the way I am” said Riker. The queen looked at him, “But you are an imperfect being and we are the height of perfection” she said. Riker looked at her pointedly, “Believing oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind” he said, “Enterprise out” he said, cutting her off before she could respond. But the image remained. She was forcing the communication through the Enterprise computer. That was how they saw Captain Smith break free of the Borg drones, knocking them over like bowling pins. He ran forward across the bridge, and dived at the Borg queen. He quickly snapped her neck, severing the tenuous balance between machine and organic components. That should have been the end of it, but the Borg had adapted as soon as the future cube came through an anomaly and established communication with the collective in this time. As the queen dropped dead, the Borg collective fell under the control of Locutus, who Captain Smith couldn’t kill for the danger of killing Captain Picard. He jumped across the bridge and deactivated the Picard drone and grabbed his communicator. Luckily for him, deactivating Locutus caused a temporary disturbance in the collective. He looked at the screen, “Lock onto my communicator while they are disrupted and beam him out of here” he said, slapping the commbadge onto the drones chest. The drone vanished from the bridge. “Captain, the Galaxy’s shields have been raised again, we can’t lock onto you” reported Commander Riker. The Captain ran to the tactical station. He looked around and found a phaser compartment underneath it. Quickly tapping the buttons on the small hand held weapon he turned it on the Borg and opened fire on the few drones on the bridge. “I’m locking out the main bridge, that should give me some control of the ship” said Smith. He checked the status, of the systems, “Damn, they managed to reroute shield controls before I locked them out” said Smith. A beeping came from the sensors, “Commander, does the Enterprise have any propulsion systems” said Captain Smith. “Yes, we have thrusters, but we aren’t going anywhere without you, Sir” said Riker. The Captain smiled, “Commander, you have the Captain, and I’m not supposed to be in this time period, if I remain, who knows how I could damage the future” said Smith, revealing something he had already been planning. “Save Picard, I’ll save the Alpha Quadrant” he said.\n As if to drive the point home, the Borg cube dropped out of warp. “Commander, lower the energy signature of the Enterprise, they shouldn’t register you” said the Captain, alone on the assimilated Galaxy’s bridge. “The Borg are conducting an intensive scan, they have lost the signal of both Captain Picard and the Borg queen” reported Worf. Riker nodded, “Data, have they detected us” he said, heavily. Data checked the sensors, “There is no indication that they have detected us, Commander” said Data. “Helm, move us away, full thrusters” ordered Commander Riker, reluctantly. “Put the Galaxy on screen” he said, taking the chair on the bridge that was previously occupied by Captain Picard or Captain Smith, 2 men who he had come to respect.\n On the Galaxy, Captain Smith was playing with the weapons and propulsion systems. He was targeting the Borg vessel. He started to work the firing. Within seconds he was pitting Borg technology against Borg technology. The Galaxy was firing on the Borg cube, but the Borg cube was battling back hard. The Captain could see instantly that he was outmatched. The ship was slammed around under the brutal assault of the Borg cube. Sparks were flying everywhere as the ship was slowly being torn apart. In a few short minutes, Smith had watched his shields reduced to 15%, his weapons were losing power and the warp core containment field was losing integrity. He was thrown to the floor as another shot slammed the ship. The shields were destroyed and the weapons failed. The sound of a critical alert filled the bridge. “Smith to Enterprise, it’s been a real experience” he said. “You too, Captain, good luck” came back Commander Riker.  Captain Smith went to the propulsion console, the ship was counting down to a warp core breach. He plotted a course at warp speed, straight at the Borg cube and engaged. As the Galaxy jumped to warp speed, the crew of the Enterprise observed a flash of metal as the ship covered the distance in seconds. The Borg cube began to tear itself apart under the stress from the impact. The day had been won. But at a heavy price.\n 6 years later\n Cadet Mark Smith stood with the Enterprise crew in the Starfleet Auditorium. It was the sixth anniversary of the Borg invasion, where Captain Picard had been assimilated and the Galaxy crew along with him. Cadet Smith glanced down the row of the crew and saw Captain Picard standing sombrely at the end of the row, alongside an Admiral whose name he couldn’t remember and Commander Riker. The Admiral was addressing the assembled crowd of Klingons and Starfleet officers. “The honoured dead fought for freedom from the Borg 6 years ago and they paid the highest price. A combined loss of nearly 10000 men and women serving in the Klingon and Federation fleets. Today we honour their sacrifice and the sacrifice made by the crew of each ship to survive the Battle of Viridian. To name the honoured would take me another 6 years, and therefore I regret that I can only name a few. The interim Captain of the Enterprise, Captain Mark Alexander Smith, put in command by Captain Picard before an attempt at an ambitious plan to rally Starfleet and her allies. General M’Tath of the Klingon 1st  Battle Group”. The Admiral went on naming the honoured dead, but Cadet Smith was thinking of just 1. Captain Mark Smith. The man he had spoken to in the darkened interior of the Enterprise. The man who despite his own apparent fears comforted children he had never met. The man who had showed him the true potential of himself. Of course, subtle changes had to be made to records, Cadet Smith now went by the name Mark Smith Jr and the records showed his father died when he slammed the USS Galaxy into a Borg cube. But other than that, Captain Mark Alexander Smith’s mission to stop the Borg causing unimaginable damage to the timelines and the future had been completely successful. There had been no sign of Borg activity since the ships self destructed and he had even fallen in love with a young woman called Alyssa May. As far as Cadet Smith was concerned life was good.\n The End", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[8, 31, "PER"], [91, 101, "SHIP"], [139, 146, "PER"], [177, 190, "PER"], [250, 254,

{"id": 633, "text": "Star Trek\n Return Fire\n Episode One: “Earl Grey, Hot”\n Bernard Schaffer\n Edited by Laurie Laliberte\n \n 1. Earl Grey, Hot\n  \n The professor looked out over the crowd of eager cadets and waited for silence.  They were the best and they knew it.  Starfleet Academy’s top students, best performers, highest decorated.  The boys in the front were strong and decided-looking, sitting with their arms flexed just enough that their biceps bulged against their uniforms, hoping one of the few females seated nearby was looking. The girls looked more focused.  They were the ones with something to prove, Wesley Crusher thought.  They were the ones who wanted revenge.     \n “May I continue?” Wesley said.  He balanced himself on his good leg to lean back against his podium and stroked his full, gray beard, making eye contact with as many of them as he could.  “This next block is probably the most difficult of all the ones I teach.  It causes more controversy than anything else you’ll learn during your time here, and probably with good reason.  It’s also the one we get the most complaints about from parents,” he added with a wry smile. “You see, Starfleet has a way of lying to its young cadets.”\n He let that one sink in for a minute, watching how the class shifted uneasily in their seats.  “It doesn’t come right out and say it, of course, but your entire curriculum, this entire facility, and the whole of Starfleet Command, has a way of propagating this myth about what you’ll experience in space.  It’s all about adventure, right?  It’s all about seeking out brave new worlds, etcetera, etcetera.  Nobody signed up to be a requisitions officer, did you?”  He scanned the room with his finger and said, “No, I didn’t think so.  You want to be a captain!  You want to be an explorer.  Right?”\n Some of the students nodded, and Wesley folded his hands behind his back.  His professor’s robe was getting tight around his middle.  The excuse he gave his doctor was that he wasn’t really becoming a saggy old man; it was simply the effects of the Earth’s gravity on him after spending his adolescent years in space.  He lifted his head and said, “Who here thinks they might die in service?”\n Nobody moved.  “Statistics prior to the Great Invasion say that twelve percent of all Starfleet Officers would either die or be critically injured in the course of their duties.  Obviously, we cannot accurately factor what those statistics were during the Invasion.  The casualty rate, particularly for women, was appallingly high during that period.  I am certain that many of you were already aware of this sad fact.”\n He looked at them, studying their faces.  Now he had their attention.  “Let me ask you this instead.  If you were going to die while in service to Starfleet, how would it be?”\n “In battle,” the young man nearest to him said.  “Killing Borg.”\n There were many murmurs of agreement to that and Wesley nodded, “Understandable.  But the Delta Quadrant is far away and the Hive has not dared cross the border in decades.  What else besides battle might take your young lives?”\n “Transporter malfunction,” someone else said.\n “Alien disease.”\n “All tragically real possibilities,” Wesley said.  He activated a large holographic projection of a starship travelling through space.  “This is classified footage of the USS Janeway Event.  You will never see it again unless you wind up working for Starfleet Intelligence.  The Janeway was on a routine mission to the Alpha Quadrant when a series of misfortunes struck.”  Wesley paused the image and aimed a bright red light on the ship’s nacelles.  The image started to move again in slow motion, going frame by frame, so that the explosion in the ship started as a small crack along its surface with bright yellow flame beneath it.  As Wesley advanced the frames, the ship blew to pieces directly in front the class.  “Fifteen hundred people onboard.  Men, women and children.  Fifteen hundred lives, here one moment, thinking about their work, their families, their problems, their lives.  Working, eating, arguing, making love, sleeping, and all the things you can imagine happen at any given time on board a vessel, gone like that,” Wesley said with a snap of his fingers.  “Not in battle.  Not saving some civilization.  A failed reactor coil.”\n The faces looked a little less confident now.  Wesley ended the projection and said, “Still, mass tragedies like the Janeway are big events.  There’s media coverage and boards of inquiry.  But large scale incidents are not the only kind that happen.  Not by a long shot.”\n He pressed a button on his console and the shimmering hologram of a dark-skinned, bald-headed man appeared before the class.  His Starfleet captain’s uniform was so perfectly detailed, Wesley could see the fabric patterns on his shirt sleeves.  “This is Captain Benjamin Sisko, one year before he led the attack on the Dominion fleet at Cardassian Prime.  By all accounts, Captain Sisko was an exemplary commanding officer and probably candidate for the Admiralty.”\n Wesley paused in front of the hologram, looking into its deeply set eyes, admiring its proud gaze.  “During his assignment to Deep Space Nine, Sisko was contacted by an alien species that occupied a nearby wormhole.  These beings would often remove Sisko from our dimension and place him inside their own, completely at their own whim.  Finally, they decided to keep him.”  Wesley looked over his shoulder at the audience, “His command, his son, his pregnant wife, and everything he knew was left behind, without any warning.  Sisko appeared in a vision to his wife and told her he expected to return in a year, that the Prophets, as they wished to be known, had much to teach him.”\n The next hologram showed a shriveled man being wheeled in front of the class, pushed by another of the Academy’s professors.  Wesley stood in the same place he had twenty years before, on the day the hologram was recorded, and the image of Miles O’Brien nodded at Wesley as it walked past.  O’Brien’s hologram pushed the withered man to a place in front of the class, then turned and walked away.  Wesley glanced at the corner of the room where one of the cadets sat, a young man with startlingly green eyes that slanted ever so slightly at the corners as evidence of his Asian heritage.  Liam O’Brian looked up as his grandfather walked past him to leave the classroom, his eyes never leaving the shimmering image until it vanished.\n Wesley walked up to the hologram sitting in its wheelchair at the front of his class and clasped his hands behind his back, making sure all of the students were looking.  It was uncomfortable for them, that much was certain.  Benjamin Sisko was an invalid whose limbs were bone-thin and curled up close to his body compulsively.  His head drooped to the side and long streams of drool spilled out of his open mouth that contained no teeth.\n “Nineteen years later, this is what returned to Deep Space Nine.  By that point, no one who had served with the Captain remained aboard or had any idea he might someday return as suddenly as he left.  He’d been declared dead by the Federation and his wife had already remarried and moved halfway across the galaxy.  My colleague, the late Professor O’Brien, whom you just saw in the hologram came upon a posting on the Engineer’s network regarding the matter and immediately recognized his former Captain.”  Wesley looked out over the class, “Benjamin Sisko lingered in the state you see him in for another five years in a Federation hospital.”\n One of the girls in the front row raised her hand, “Why did the Prophets want him?”\n Wesley shrugged, “We will never be certain.  At the time, Captain Sisko thought he was destined to fulfill their grand scheme, and in some ways, he may have been.  The whole story is never quite apparent to us, though, and whatever their reasons for keeping him inside the wormhole, he was not the same when he returned.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[2276, 2285, "ORG"], [55, 71, "PER"], [83, 99, "PER"], [129, 138, "PER"], [244, 263, "ORG"], [595, 609, "PER"], [683, 689, "PER"], [1144, 1153, "ORG"], [1408, 1425, "ORG"], [1829, 1835, "PER"], [1953, 1959, "PER"], [2045, 2052, "LOC"], [2758, 2767, "ORG"], [2846, 2850, "SPEC"], [2903, 2909, "PER"], [2944, 2958, "LOC"], [2979, 2983, "ORG"], [3186, 3192, "PER"], [3324, 3331, "SHIP"], [3399, 3421, "ORG"], [3428, 3435, "SHIP"], [3468, 3482, "LOC"], [3522, 3528, "PER"], [3788, 3794, "PER"], [4188, 4194, "PER"], [4349, 4355, "PER"], [4419, 4426, "SHIP"], [4705, 4714, "ORG"], [4760, 4766, "SHIP"], [4829, 4851, "PER"], [4894, 4902, "GPE"], [4912, 4928, "LOC"], [4948, 4961, "PER"], [5029, 5038, "ORG"], [5042, 5048, "PER"], [5168, 5183, "LOC"], [5185, 5190, "PER"], [5291, 5296, "PER"], [5416, 5422, "PER"], [5569, 5574, "PER"], [5663, 5671, "ORG"], [5829, 5838, "ORG"], [5852, 5858, "PER"], [5966, 5979, "PER"], [5990, 5996, "PER"], [6017, 6026, "PER"], [6124, 6130, "PER"], [6315, 6327, "PER"], [6461, 6467, "PER"], [6687, 6701, "PER"], [6950, 6965, "LOC"], [7014, 7021, "PER"], [7134, 7144, "GPE"], [7241, 7258, "PER"], [7321, 7331, "ORG"], [7399, 7406, "PER"], [7410, 7416, "PER"], [7445, 7459, "PER"], [7525, 7535, "GPE"], [7612, 7620, "ORG"], [7633, 7639, "PER"], [7691, 7704, "PER"]]}
{"id": 634, "text": "Some of the cadets were visibly distressed by the image on the hologram, covering their eyes with their hands, or looking down at their desks.  Wesley paused the image and brought up the first one, of a proud, strong Captain Benjamin Sisko in his Starfleet Uniform.  Wesley stood beside the hologram and said, “I suggest that any of you would be lucky to be compared to the man standing before you, both in terms of service and capability.  I also suggest that if something like this can happen to him, it can happen to you.”  Wesley turned the hologram off and clapped his hands together loudly, breaking the spell of despair that had fallen over his audience, “Okay, now that you’re all thoroughly depressed, I have some good news.  You’re getting out early today.”  The cadets faces instantly brightened and began to shift around in their seats to gather their things, forcing Wesley to raise his voice, “Those of you taking The Test tomorrow should go home and get some rest.  In other words, don’t go out to the bars.”\n He watched as his class got up from their seats and began to file out.  For a moment, Liam O’Brien stopped in his passage toward the door, looking at the professor as if he were about to say something.  Wesley turned toward the young man and said, “Yes?” but by then, Liam had already turned away.\n ***\n The sun was setting over the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay glistened in hues of red and gold, as if the water were summoning it down to rest.  As the Academy’s most senior professor, Wesley had his choice of offices.  The one with the best view also happened to be the one closest to his classroom.  He looked at the hover chair sitting in the corner of the room, the same one he’d ridden in as he finally left the hospital after the Invasion and returned to the Academy.  People lined the halls as he entered, the chair whirring six inches off the ground like an elaborate flying carpet.  They welcomed him home and smiled kindly as he passed, but raw pity was evident on their faces.\n That day, he’d stood up from the chair and refused to use it ever again.\n Wesley sipped the rest of his wine, red and strong to the last, then lifted the green glass bottle from his table to refill it.  The label was worn and faded now.  “Chateau Picard, Labarre,” he whispered with a quiet nod.  Of course, the wine he was drinking had not been bottled in France.  The original bottle had been a gift from Jean-Luc many decades ago and Wesley had entered its composition into his office’s food replicator.  It had been so long since he’d tasted the original that he often wondered if he would even recognize it any longer.  He always refilled it in the same bottle though.  It helped support the illusion.\n His door beeped and Wesley set down the bottle and said, “Come in.”\n The doors whisked open instantly.  “Good evening, Professor Crusher.  I hope I’m not intruding on you.”\n Wesley turned to see Liam O’Brien standing in his doorway.  He held up his empty glass and said, “I always enjoy a drink after teaching that particular module.  I suppose it is my attempt to gain some sort of perspective.”  The cadet nodded silently, clearly he had no idea what the old man was talking about.  Wesley waved for him to come and sit and said, “What can I do for you, Liam?”\n “Tomorrow’s my day.  For the test, I mean.”\n “So it is,” Wesley said.  “And what have you done to prepare yourself?”\n “Besides come here, you mean?”\n Wesley smiled softly, “I am forbidden from telling you anything about the test.  Your grandfather would never forgive me.”\n Liam held up his hand, “That isn’t what I meant, Professor.  I just wanted someone to talk to. Someone I could trust.”  He pointed at the glass in Wesley’s hand and said, “Someone with a little perspective.”\n “I see,” Wesley said.  He eased himself down on the couch and massaged his ruined leg, grunting as he worked the tangle of muscles and cybernetics that formed his thigh and knee.   “Well, when I was your age and took the test, it was still the old Klingon scenario.”\n Liam’s eyes widened, “Really?”\n Wesley nodded, “Seems a little moot now, doesn’t it?  I doubt any of you have ever even seen a Klingon.  Anyway, I was on the committee that proposed changing the test.  You would not believe the resistance we faced from the senior faculty.  Some traditions die harder than others.  No one wanted to admit that such an important part of their youth had become obsolete.”\n “But you did change it, obviously,” Liam said.  “All of the postings I’ve seen talk about different scenarios that are randomly chosen.  It could be the Dominion, the Tholians, I guess the obvious choice is … ” the young man’s voice trailed off.\n “The Borg,” Wesley said quietly.  “It’s all right, Liam.  You can say it around me.”\n “Yes, professor,” Liam said.  He looked down at his hands, “I’m sorry.”\n “It’s quite all right.  I learned a very long time ago that life goes on, regardless of what you lose or how you lose it.”\n “Is that why you drink?”\n “To forget my wife and daughter, you mean?” Wesley said.\n “Yes.”\n “No,” Wesley said.  “I drink to try and gain perspective about losing them.”\n Liam sighed and stood up, “I am sorry I disturbed you, professor.  It was rude of me to come here.”\n “On the contrary,” Wesley said, “I feel honored.  Cadets traditionally visit the holodecks to seek guidance from James T. Kirk.  They think they might somehow glean some of his secrets as to how to beat The Test.  That’s good enough company for me to be in, I think.”\n Liam smiled with slight embarrassment, “I already talked to Kirk.”\n “You did?” Wesley said.  “And what did he say?”\n “I … don’t believe … in the … no-win … scenario!” Liam said, mimicking the hologram’s voice to near perfection.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[144, 150, "PER"], [217, 239, "PER"], [247, 256, "ORG"], [267, 273, "PER"], [527, 533, "PER"], [880, 886, "PER"], [1111, 1123, "PER"], [1228, 1234, "PER"], [1293, 1297, "PER"], [1400, 1403, "LOC"], [1495, 1504, "ORG"], [1528, 1534, "PER"], [1808, 1815, "ORG"], [2106, 2112, "PER"], [2287, 2294, "LOC"], [2389, 2395, "LOC"], [2439, 2447, "PER"], [2469, 2475, "PER"], [2760, 2766, "PER"], [2859, 2876, "PER"], [2914, 2920, "PER"], [2935, 2947, "PER"], [3225, 3231, "PER"], [3296, 3300, "PER"], [3361, 3367, "PER"], [3454, 3460, "PER"], [3578, 3582, "PER"], [3627, 3636, "PER"], [3725, 3733, "PER"], [3796, 3802, "PER"], [4035, 4042, "SPEC"], [4055, 4061, "PER"], [4087, 4093, "PER"], [4182, 4189, "PER"], [4495, 4499, "PER"], [4612, 4620, "GPE"], [4626, 4634, "SPEC"], [4711, 4715, "SPEC"], [4718, 4724, "PER"], [4757, 4761, "PER"], [4810, 4814, "PER"], [4798, 4807, "PER"], [5059, 5065, "PER"], [5087, 5093, "PER"], [5159, 5163, "PER"], [5214, 5223, "PER"], [5279, 5285, "PER"], [5373, 5386, "PER"], [5529, 5533, "PER"], [5589, 5593, "PER"], [5608, 5614, "PER"], [5696, 5700, "PER"]]}
{"id": 635, "text": "Wesley laughed, “Yes, well, holodecks were invented long after Kirk’s time.  They had to piece together his persona from old starlogs and the like.  I’m sure the actual person was far less flamboyant.  You’ll get much better results from more modern people, the ones who were properly scanned with thought toward living on in holodeck form to give guidance to the rest of us.”\n “Do you have any suggestions?” Liam said.\n Wesley took a long sip of his wine and said, “Only one comes to mind.”\n ***\n Whoever used the holodeck before him forgot to clear their list of preferences.  Wesley only glanced at the selection, knowing that the entire area was under constant surveillance and having no desire to be reprimanded for intruding on someone else’s privacy.  But still, the choices were salacious.\n Night with an Orion slave girl. \n Night as an Orion slave girl. \n Tribble touch. \n The Captain’s harsh reprimand. \n Liam surpassed a laugh and cleared the screen, pulling up the program that Professor Crusher had provided him.  Liam took a deep breath and opened the holodeck doors.  He stepped into a brightly lit countryside, with rolling hills of green that looked down at a small village far below.  Chimney smoke trailed up from their roofs toward the open blue sky where the massive cumulus clouds looked something like a starship armada hovering overhead.\n He kept walking, searching in every direction for some sign of importance.  The professor had refused to tell him who he was going to see or what.  For all he knew, he was about to experience the first air raid of the second World War, or the quiet moments just before the Great Invasion.  Liam found himself spinning around in circles as he searched the sky for signs of movement, now wishing the enormous clouds were gone so he had a clearer view.\n A man called out to him, “Can I help you, young man?”\n Liam bolted upright, reflexively snapping to attention.  He quickly pulled down on his uniform to adjust it and announced himself, “Starfleet cadet Liam H. O’Brien, sir.  Senior year, command school, sir.”\n The old man was dressed in a long grey smock decorated with slashes of paint.  His arms and hands were tinged with light blue and white, the same colors that were now running from the long paintbrush in his hand onto the grass at his feet.  Liam wondered if he’d been painting a picture or simply rolling around in the paints for fun.\n “Professor Crusher sent me, sir.  To speak with you.”\n “Ah,” the old man said.  “In that case, go away.”  With that, he turned from Liam and headed back toward a small easel perched on the crest of the hill.\n “Sir?” Liam said, hurrying after him.\n “I said, go away!  Tell Wesley that he should know me better than to send some cadet to try and lure me back to the academy.  I shall not return.”\n Liam found he had to walk quickly to keep up with the man, who must be in his early nineties but still moved with a certain speed that belied his age.  He was trim and spry and Liam thought that if perhaps the man were not so bald he might have guessed him to be only in his late sixties.  “I didn’t come to lure you back to anything,” Liam called out.  “Wait, why won’t you go back to the Academy?  What’s wrong with it?”\n “Too much to do!”  The old man stopped in front of his easel and scowled at the image painted on it.  He sighed with defeat and threw down his paintbrush, “Utter rubbish.  You would think that after all this time I could paint a simple French countryside, but alas, my hands and vision betray me.”\n “You could always get your eyes re-focused.  Or your synapses enhanced to compensate for old age,” Liam said.\n The old man’s face wrinkled into a scowl.\n Liam turned back to the painting and said, “Actually, I think it’s pretty good.”\n The old man stopped and reconsidered the painting, moving to where the boy stood to see if from his angle.  “I suppose it has a certain rustic charm.  What did you say your name was?”\n “Liam O’Brian, sir.  Starfleet cadet.”\n The old man held out his paint-covered hand, “Jean-Luc Picard.  Private citizen.  Also, dead person.”\n Liam cocked his head, “Sorry, sir?”\n “Dead person,” Picard said.  “Do you really believe I’m standing on this hill with you?  According to the records, I died thirty years ago.”  He eyed the young cadet warily, “You do know this is a computer simulation, lad, don’t you?”\n “Well, yes, I do.  I’m just not sure you’re supposed to.”\n “It was one of the requirements I gave when they wanted to hook all those things up to me and scan and graph every little corner of my brain.

{"id": 636, "text": "Star Trek: Icarus\n -1-\n The distraught young woman clad in a drab grey jumpsuit stepped out of the tiny automated shuttlecraft, hair in disarray from the penant-fluttering breeze, an old and durably utilitarian khaki duffel bag slung over her shoulder, and stopped and stared; she was wholly unprepared for the chaos of San Francisco’s South Shuttle Terminal, and felt painfully conspicuous and out of place.\n She had never before felt air so humid, had never seen a place so full of colour and activity. To her eyes the intense green of the surrounding cascades of immense, towering foliage, the impossibly blue sky and the listless blue-green ocean seemed almost artificial, an assault on her senses so overwhelming that it made her feel almost physically ill. By contrast, the pale yellow\n skies, tan deserts, scrub plains and empty quiet of the world on she’d grown up formed a serene, nostalgic contrast to the background of her thoughts.\n Well, she was here. Now, what?\n She had been found out and dismissed a matter of hours earlier from the Erbean deep-space freighter Gallant; the lie that had got her into the merchant service had also been her undoing. On her application she had claimed to be half Vulcan, half human. She was, in truth, half Vulcan, but the other half, the unruly, emotional half that tortured her with empathic feelings she wasn’t equipped to deal with, was Betazoid. \n She had concealed the beguiling depth of her large, dark Betazoid eyes with contacts, but a sharp-eyed shipmate, the captain’s willful and manipulative concubine, Farina, had seen through the ruse and reported her. Now she was dismissed, in disgrace, and without a home. \n Neither Vulcan nor Beta Zed had been an option. She couldn’t tolerate the shame of being among Vulcans because of the emotions she couldn’t conceal, nor could she tolerate the empathy or the open emotionalism of Betazoids, and the intolerable invasion of her own, private, personal demons. The mere thought of returning to the Federation colony where she’d grown up caused her\n insides to feel curdled; there, for her whole entire life, she had been an unwanted outcast. Pure chance had decided her upon a nearby planet called Earth and the dubious prospect of finding some form of employment. She grimaced, inwardly. Her one real qualification for any type of work on this world was that she was relatively fluent in the widely-spoken language called English Standard, which in its earliest form had apparently originated on this strange world, though because of its uncanny flexibility it was now one of the most widely spoken languages in the Federation.\n The sight of the new-risen sun caused her to moan inwardly in tired frustration. By her departed ship’s clock it was around 01:30 hours. This world was at least thirteen and a half hours out-of-sync with her body clock. What she needed right now, more than anything, was something familiar, or at least palatable to eat, a shower, and then bed and the forgetfulness and escape of\n sleep!\n She stared in astonishment as a woman lifted a child and held it up to what she had assumed to be some sort of local religious icon; it was a small ornate fountain with a plaque affixed to its side. The child drank her fill, the mother then held the child on her hip and did the\n same, and then they were off, the woman pushing the child before her in a small, lightweight, wheeled contraption. \n Watching carefully for disapproving looks from the locals, she approached the fountain herself, still amazed by the sight of sparkling, free-running water. She was careful to taste it first, just to be certain that it was what it appeared to be . . . the water was good, and very\n cold. She drank deeply, and was soon refreshed, but the water only served to exacerbate her hunger pangs.\n At the entrance to the interior of the Shuttle Terminal was an icon she recognised, a small sign hanging from the ceiling with an arrow, a black silhouette of a plate with a human-style knife and fork to either side, and the words “Food Court” underneath in English Standard. \n The Food Court was utter chaos! It was a huge open area with a domed glass roof, the entire perimeter of which was one continuous riot of mercantile food businesses. The whole entire floorspace was covered with tables and chairs, dotted with occasional litter bins, cleaning\n stations, and enormous live plants. Hanging from the ceiling in various places were monitors showing various types of information and entertainment. Each table had its own speaker, computer outlet and translator. And the crush of people! She had no idea that humans came in so many shapes, sizes and colours, that they spoke such a babel of disparate languages. There were many aliens as well . . . feeling ashamed, she tried not to look at anyone for fear that they would notice her own appearance in their turn.\n Her selection was made for her by the icons displaying which currencies and forms of credit were acceptable. The selection available to her was not great. With great reluctance, she approached a Vulcan booth, unable to look the server in the eye. To make matters worse, the woman serving her took her time, all-too-obviously scrutinizing her appearance. Feeling rattled, as though everyone were staring at her, she hastily paid the woman, moved away to an unoccupied table, ate her meal automatically and self-consciously, and went back outside.\n Groaning inwardly, she began pushing her way through the crush of people. Several very large shuttles had just landed, and more were high above in holding patterns. She stopped to look about for a chronometer. Someone jostled her from behind, and apologised.\n “Sorry! Didn’t mean to interrupt your daydreaming.”\n Embarrassed, she found herself blocking a line of people about to board another shuttle.\n She noticed, then, a forty-ish man standing nearby, who gave her uniform a look, causing her to squirm involuntarily. There was no disguising a uniform stripped of insignia. To her misgiving, the man approached her. Was her presence here illegal?\n “May I assume that you’re between commissions?”\n Feeling very shy and intimidated, she shrugged, unable to meet his gaze, and began moving away.\n “We have several openings in commissary, if you’re interested.”\n The sight of his Starfleet uniform caused her to shake her head automatically. “You wouldn’t want someone like me,” she muttered. “I’ve just been dismissed.” She started to turn away from him.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[320, 358, "LOC"], [1077, 1084, "SHIP"], [1049, 1055, "SPEC"], [1210, 1216, "SPEC"], [1223, 1228, "SPEC"], [1254, 1260, "SPEC"], [1388, 1396, "SPEC"], [1457, 1465, "SPEC"], [1563, 1569, "PER"], [1681, 1687, "LOC"], [1692, 1700, "LOC"], [1768, 1775, "SPEC"], [1885, 1894, "SPEC"], [2000, 2017, "LOC"], [2200, 2205, "LOC"], [2619, 2629, "GPE"], [3845, 3861, "LOC"], [4088, 4098, "LOC"], [4619, 4625, "SPEC"], [5070, 5076, "SPEC"], [6301, 6310, "ORG"]]}

Nobody . . . wants me.” She hadn’t meant to blurt it out so bitterly, and fled, as much from him as from a premonition of the humiliating tears she couldn’t control. \n A hand on her arm stopped her.\n “Let go of me.”\n “The job’s still open if you want it, young lady. I’m not one to give up on people easily. And I’m not one to discriminate.

{"id": 638, "text": "“You may ask,” he told her, watching her reaction with amusement. And then, smiling, “I’m captain Daniel Rusk, and my ship is the U.S.S. New Brighton. And as of now, you are crewman Sarin V’al.” He chuckled at her reaction at hearing her own name. “To tell the truth, I and my crew were watching for you.” His eyes hardened, causing her to watch him apprehensively; she could feel his anger, and reacted with fear. “The captain of the Gallant is known to Starfleet. You can rest assured that he was well aware of your little deception from the beginning.”\n She couldn’t help but stare. \n “How can you know that?”\n His responding smile was devoid of humour. “When you were found out, he asked you to do certain things for him. I know this because that is how he operates. And the fact that you were dismissed tells me that you refused to go along. Correct?”\n She couldn’t meet his eye, and swallowed, reflexively. \n “Had you allowed yourself to be used by him, that would only have been the beginning, for he would have held that, and everything subsequent he coerced you into doing, over your head. Did he threaten your family?”\n “I haven’t got any family!” she blurted, bitterly.\n Captain Rusk raised an eyebrow at this. “Well, that explains why you were able to get away from him.” To the question in her eyes, he said, “It’s very difficult to threaten a person with nothing with blackmail. I am in no doubt that for the first time in your short life, having nothing has saved you.”\n –\n The twelve hours of setting up and readying the commissary went by in a daze, and at the end of her shift Sarin made her way to her new quarters, gave up on a shower as the stall was already occupied, flopped down on the lower of one of the two sets of bunk beds, and tried to fall asleep. As she lay, half-aware of what went on around her, she listened to the three young women with whom she shared quarters, who discreetly spoke quietly as they readied themselves for bed.\n All three were young, self-involved human girls. One was Kimberley, a waitress who worked in the ship’s lounge, one was Joanna, part of the cleaning staff, and the remaining girl, Patricia, was a cook who, like all cooks, loved complaining about replicator food. \n Joanna climbed into the bunk above Sarin and plunked herself down, noisily. “I thought you were supposed to be shipping out on the Enterprise.” This, to Kimberley.\n Kimberley lay on her chest in the other top bunk. “I couldn’t get there in time. They left in a big hurry. To tell the truth, I dragged my feet a bit. When they leave in a big hurry like that it’s usually because there’s some sort of trouble. And I don’t happen to like the idea of getting blown up.” \n Patricia, who had been in the shower, came out drying her hair and sat on the other bottom bunk. “What’s the new girl’s name?”\n Joanna leaned over and looked down at Sarin’s paperwork which lay on top of her tiny dressing table. “Says here her name is Sarin V’al. Crewman. Assignation . . . Pending.”\n “I saw her in the commissary earlier,” Patricia put in. “She kept to herself all day.”\n “She’s not Vulcan, is she?” Kimberley sounded put-out. Though she was whispering, Sarin heard her clearly. \n “Craig told me she’s half Vulcan, half Betazoid.”\n “Half Betazoid!” Kimberley leaned over to scrutinize the newcomer, her curiosity piqued. “What a mix! An emotionless calculator being constantly flooded with other people’s emotions!”\n “She’s not emotionless,” Patricia told her a little disparagingly, “and neither are Vulcans. Vulcans are repressed, not emotionless. If you think Vulcans are emotionless, try babysitting their kids! You’ll never look at Vulcans the same way again.”\n “Maybe she’s really part Romulan,” Kimberley speculated, hoping for a little scandal. “Except for her ears, she doesn’t look at all Vulcan. Well,” she conceded, “her eyebrows, too. But otherwise, she looks just like we do.”\n “It says ‘none’ under next of kin,” Joanna said with a frown, having read the rest of the girl’s paperwork. “I’ll bet her mother abandoned her when she found out-” she stopped herself at Sarin’s look. Sarin roused herself, picked up her duffle bag, went into the washroom, and shut the door amid the ensuing embarrassed silence.\n –\n Kimberley’s words wouldn’t have hurt so much if they hadn’t been the literal truth of Sarin’s life. She had been a foundling, abandoned at birth at a Federation colony spaceport. The only records that might yield a clue were of an unregistered ship and a recording from the spaceport cameras which showed a shawled, veiled woman depositing a baby’s carryall on a bench and vanishing into the thick of the crowd. And with the child, in the carryall, was an unsigned note, an outpouring of bitter vitriol. \n To Sarin, Kimberley’s words sounded like the smug self-assurance of one who had grown up, raised, loved and cared for by her parents. Sarin had no such self-assurance. Instead, she had a yawning hole in her life of unbearable loneliness that had shaped her spirit far differently than the human girls. At the core of her being was bleak, irremediable angst and bitterness, and a deep hurt and sense of betrayal that life itself would single her out so cruelly. \n The human girls were far more resilient than herself, she could tell. They had resources\n borne of reassurance. \n She herself had none. \n Yet she persevered somehow. She got into her nightdress, pulled on her bathrobe, and wondered at the stubbornness that kept her going.\n –", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[90, 109, "PER"], [137, 149, "SHIP"], [182, 192, "PER"], [435, 442, "SHIP"], [455, 464, "ORG"], [1182, 1194, "PER"], [1595, 1600, "PER"], [2001, 2006, "SPEC"], [2022, 2031, "PER"], [2062, 2075, "LOC"], [2085, 2091, "PER"], [2145, 2153, "PER"], [2230, 2236, "PER"], [2265, 2270, "PER"], [2361, 2371, "SHIP"], [2383, 2392, "PER"], [2395, 2404, "PER"], [2698, 2706, "PER"], [2826, 2832, "PER"], [2864, 2871, "PER"], [2950, 2960, "PER"], [3039, 3047, "PER"], [3099, 3105, "SPEC"], [3116, 3125, "PER"], [3170, 3175, "PER"], [3198, 3203, "PER"], [3223, 3229, "SPEC"], [3236, 3244, "SPEC"], [3254, 3262, "SPEC"], [3265, 3274, "PER"], [3458, 3466, "PER"], [3517, 3524, "SPEC"], [3526, 3533, "SPEC"], [3653, 3660, "SPEC"], [3708, 3715, "SPEC"], [3815, 3821, "SPEC"], [3718, 3727, "PER"], [3944, 3950, "PER"], [4095, 4102, "PER"], [4109, 4114, "PER"], [4241, 4252, "PER"], [4327, 4334, "PER"], [4391, 4418, "LOC"], [4750, 4755, "PER"], [4757, 4768, "PER"], [4881, 4886, "PER"], [5036, 5041, "SPEC"], [5214, 5219, "SPEC"]]}

The bodies of the four other drones who were with me during the collision lay mangled on the cold, snowy mountainside, grossly disfigured.\n “Then that is where I will wait,” I reply. Geordi stays by my side as we walk to the wreckage. I am amazed that I had ever survived the crash; the damage to the ship is extensive.\n We come to a stop and I look at the visor hiding Geordi’s eyes. The half ring allows him sight through implants embedded in his temples. Perhaps we are not all that different, Geordi and me.\n “Well, I guess this is it, huh?” he says quietly. “So long, Hugh.”\n There is sorrow in his voice. Sorrow, because we are friends.\n “Goodbye, Geordi. I will try to remember you.”\n He sighs and looks down, then slowly walks a few meters away. As he turns and looks at me again, two Borg drones materialize on a ridge above us. They scan Geordi, but detect no threat and make their way towards me.\n They stand on either side of me, and I lift my right hand to allow for one of them to inject me back into the Collective.\n As I close my eyes, I feel the familiar link awaken within my mind – thousands of voices, their thoughts a part of my own. I add my voice to theirs, the memories I have collected since being removed, but I do not lose control of my newly-found sense of identity. This subtle resistance does not appear to alert the Collective.\n I help the drones collect parts from the deceased, and the Borg ship in the atmosphere of the moon dematerializes the remnants, transporting them up to the ship to be reabsorbed, their components to be reused by new drones.\n We make our way back up to the ridge and stand side-by-side, awaiting our own transportation back up to the ship. I feel the beginnings of dematerialization, and glance once more at my friend Geordi, letting him know that I am still more than just the designation Third of Five. I am Hugh.\n ***\n The small, cube-shaped vessel I materialize into is nearly identical to the ship I had been on — the same that lies in ruins on the frozen moon I just left Geordi on. A Minor Hexahedron. There are three drones already residing in interlink nodes, and the two who brought me back enter and link up inside the other chambers spread out across the walls.\n There is a minor difference to this ship, though. It has been modified and equipped with a sixth interlink node sitting directly in the middle of the deck, which slightly cramps the area. As I rest inside the node and interface with the link, I sense immediate confusion; the claustrophobic thought has captured the attention of the five other drones. They look at me, and I hear their voices mingling as one.\n <Is a sixth interlink node problematic on this vessel?>\n <No, it is nothing,> I assure them. <It was just an observational difference, not something to be alerted about.>\n The other drones seem to process my comment slowly. Their confusion compounds as they analyze my thoughts. I try to change the subject.\n <What is my new designation?> I ask.\n Their melded voices fill my mind. <You’re designation as Third of Five has been terminated. A new designation will be assigned to you once we reach the nearest Mega Hexahedron.> They pause briefly as they analyze my recent memories. <You have already claimed another designation. An identification provided by Species 5618?>\n <Hugh>. I stumble across the name as I think it. <I am Hugh.>\n <We are Borg,> they say boldly.\n <Yes, we are Borg,> I agree. <But I am Hugh.>\n More analysis hits my mind. Just days ago I would have given anything to share my thoughts with the Collective once again. But this felt more like an interrogation. These thoughts and memories were mine.

My words are reminiscent of Beverly’s when she had explained that she did not want to be assimilated.\n <Irrelevant.

And that is when I feel the massive consciousness focus on me, analyzing my resistant thoughts. Why do they center their attention on me? I am but one drone on a small vessel. There are other drones elsewhere in other systems assimilating other species even now. Surely I am not more important than they.\n I access their thoughts and discover that this has never happened before. There has never been resistance within the Collective. Even Locutus did not resist. But I am Hugh, and I told Captain Picard that I would try to remember that fact.\n <Captain Picard,> the Collective says as it reads my thoughts. <You have had contact with Locutus.>\n <Yes.>\n <Even he told you resistance is futile.>\n <Resistance is not futile,> I reply, thinking of my conversation with the dark-skinned female on the Enterprise who came to me while I was confined behind a force field. I never did learn her identification. <Some have escaped.>\n <Irrelevant. They will be found. All will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.>\n They continue to analyze my thoughts and memories being with the humans’ ship.\n At last, the Collective says, <You have malfunctioned. Species 5618 has corrupted your processing. Your components will be reabsorbed and distributed to maturation chambers aboard the Mega Hexahedron approaching your current trajectory.>\n <I do not wish to be terminated,> I reply. Emotion is a biologically based symptom of individuality. My mind is being forced to assimilate them, and the current feeling I’m experiencing is unpleasant. It is the same emotion I’ve witnessed on the faces of every individual of every species I have previously brought into the Collective. Fear, they call it.\n I hear the Collective address the other five drones surrounding me. I hear them issue the command to terminate me, to remove my components, separate the machine from the biological, and to discard my body into space.\n Without a second thought, the five drones step away from their nodes and approach me slowly, mechanical arms whizzing up, preparing to dismantle my components.\n And the emotion I had previously felt and defined as fear was but a minuscule definition of what I felt now. Terror. Terror filled my mind. Odd how an emotion can invade a mind, dashing away thought so easily. How… “human” of me.\n Still, they circle me, and had I the capacity to think of escape options, I would react logically to the situation. But all I feel is a deep, dark terror.\n  \n ***\n Their buzzing instruments are dangerously close, and without realizing what I am doing, I push my terror out across the link. The surrounding drones instantly recoil, staring at me with haunted eyes as they stumble away from me.\n Of all the weapons the hundreds of species the Collective has come in contact with, of all the weapons that have been used against us, nothing has ever caused this kind of response. Confusion replaces the terror the five drones had just experienced, and I see them reach once again to the Collective for help.\n <Terminate him,> the Collective responds.\n The drones hesitate, looking at me with… fear?\n Ship sensors begin to sound. A simple tap into them tells me that we are approaching the larger Borg cube. I can sense the hundreds of minds on the massive cube.\n The Collective again addresses the five other drones cowering before me. <You will bring this drone aboard the Mega Hexahedron. There, the drones are prepared to reabsorb the one formerly known as Third of Five.>\n I feel the ship slow down the rest of the way as the Mega Hexahedron pulls us in with a tractor beam. Before we can even dock, I feel myself beginning to dematerialize. The other five drones are also phasing out.\n I rematerialize inside a vast opening full of cylinders that vary in size. An eerie green light barely illuminates off the black walls.

I panic, and so do the drones next to me.\n Thousands of voices speak at us at the same time. <We have come to reabsorb your components into the most recently assimilated children of a species recently caught.> The thought is not directed at me alone, but the five other drones with me.\n <But we are Borg, and we have not been modified,> they argue.\n There is no hesitation from the Collective. <Your thoughts have been contaminated by the one who has been modified.

I cannot help but detect malice in the voice, but I am likely seeing emotion where it does not exist. <Uplinks to the Collective will be severed momentarily.>\n And then it happens.

It is strange to hear another Borg speak. One voice is quiet. “But there are no other voices. They are gone.”\n I look at the exile. “Yes. What you are saying is that you are lonely.” I look around the chamber and see that, even with hundreds of exiles standing together, they are all completely alone. I know that feeling. Beverly had first said it, but the woman with dark skin had defined it. I never did learn her designation.\n Designation. A name.\n I look back at the Borg standing next to me and say, “You require a new designation. A name to distinguish you from the others.”\n He looks at me in confusion. “My designation is Second of Five.”\n “There are several Seconds of Fives on this vessel,” I reply. “You need a new designation to distinguish yourself from the others.”\n He tilts his head, processing my request. “This request is acceptable. What is my new designation?”\n I do not know. Geordi and Beverly had given me the name Hugh. This exile waits expectantly for me to assign him a name. Should I do so?\n I pause. I do not understand the origin of names, but I understand their purpose. I immediately create one, and say, “Your name is Lentah.”\n He processes the name, accepting it easily, just as I had done with Geordi.\n “We are Lentah.”\n I put my hand on my chest and say, “I am Hugh.” I point back to him and say, “You are Lentah.”\n “You are Hugh,” he echoes. “We are Lentah.”\n How many cycles had it taken me to learn to speak in terms of “I” and “me?” Even now, I do not fully understand or comprehend my own individuality.\n But the renaming of the exiles could be problematic.

Is there any evidence of nanoprobes at work here?” The desiccated corpse of a Borg drone he’d stumbled upon on an away mission last week was still fresh in his mind. The specter of Borg cubes lurking just outside of sensor range in the murky depths of the Nekrid Expanse had haunted him ever since.\n “Certainly not any of Borg design,” said the Doctor, alleviating his fears but not quashing them completely. “My tests are ongoing, though.”\n Chakotay studied the diagram closer. “What do you make of this one?” he said, pointing at the alien construct occupying the diagram’s skull.\n “That implant is the one that worries me the most,” said the Doctor. “Its processes are threaded throughout her brain. It might influence her cognition and her perceptions, bias her behavior… it could conceivably even be controlling her body. I’ll monitor her engrams for any irregularities when she wakes.”\n Chakotay was quiet for a moment, regarding his unconscious officer. He’d let her down, back on that space station. He hadn’t acted fast enough when that pod had opened. He should have destroyed the thing the moment it made a sound. He should have acted faster when the cables ensnared Ensign Kang. If only he’d been faster, sharper, quicker on his feet…\n He wouldn’t let her down now. The alien space station still had her, even if she was out of the pod. He had to find a way to stop its progress before it finished turning her into… whatever it was turning her into.\n But, he couldn’t let himself forget, he also had a duty to protect the rest of the crew. He tapped his combadge. “Chakotay to Tuvok,” he said.\n “Tuvok here, sir.”\n “Assign two security personnel to sickbay. The Doctor will brief them when they arrive.”\n “Acknowledged,” said Tuvok.\n Chakotay met the Doctor’s gaze, and the Doctor nodded his understanding.\n “Under alien control or not, our crewmember is still in there, Doctor,” said Chakotay. “I know you’ll do everything in your power to help her.”\n “Of course, sir,” said the Doctor.\n Chakotay walked out of the Doctor’s office and crossed sickbay. The doors to the corridor opened as he approached, and standing outside was Chief Vance, looking very dour. That was fast, thought Chakotay. But then he noticed that the security officer wasn’t approaching the door, but apparently dithering in the corridor. “Is there something I can help you with, Chief?” said Chakotay.\n Vance jumped to attention at the sight of his senior officer. “No, sir. I just wanted to know if I could visit the patient.”\n Chakotay felt his eyebrow rising and quickly schooled his facial expression. “You’ll have to ask the Doctor,” he said, and then he passed out into the corridor.\n  \n “…told her how you felt, before?” It was a gentle, feminine voice. Lucy was sure she recognized it.\n “Yes… well… I mean, I think she has the general idea,” said someone else. It was a man’s voice, low and brash, and the connotations of his tenor stirred a sense of attraction, balanced on a knife’s edge with a sense of discomfort.\n Owen, that was the second one.

{"id": 11, "text": "Off to Lucy’s right, something started beeping. It sounded like a sickbay biomonitor.\n “Doctor!” Kes called, and then she leaned in close to Lucy. “Ensign, are you awake?”\n Lucy opened her eyes and took in the faces around her. Owen stood on her left, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Kes sat on her right, holding Lucy’s hand. A couple other security officers stood guard by the sickbay doors. The Doctor was approaching from his office, his face a mask of concern.\n “Ensign?” said the Doctor, “How are you feeling?”\n Lucy took stock of herself for a moment. The sickbay bed she was lying on was comfortable. The sickbay blanket felt nice on her skin. “I feel alright,” she said. She propped herself up on her elbows, and as her weight shifted, she noticed something about her body was… off. She couldn’t immediately pin down what it was, though.\n The Doctor took a medical tricorder off a nearby shelf and began scanning her. Without lifting his eyes from the device, he tapped his badge and said, “Doctor to the Bridge.”\n “Janeway here, Doctor,” came the captain’s voice. “What’s your status?”\n “Ensign Kang is awake, sir.”\n “Acknowledged, Doctor. Thank you.”\n The Doctor stopped scanning and looked back at his patient.\n “Are you in any pain?” he said.\n Lucy shook her head. “No, I’m good.”\n The Doctor’s concerned expression didn’t waver. “Do you know where you are right now, Ensign?”\n Lucy chuckled a little at the question. “Sickbay. Voyager. The Delta Quadrant.”\n The Doctor bit his lip for a moment and said, “Do you know why you’re in sickbay, Ensign Kang?”\n “Well…” said Lucy, and she glanced around at the others gathered around her bed. The intensity with which the Doctor, Kes and Owen were all looking at her was starting to make her a little bit uncomfortable. The security officers at the door to sickbay were troubling, as well.\n She returned her attention to the Doctor. “I mean after what happened on the space station…” she cast a meaningful glance at Owen. It had been an intense ordeal, and Owen, at least, would know a bit about what she’d been through. “It’s hardly a surprise.”\n The Doctor nodded. He still looked worried. Lucy wondered why. She was fine, now. She felt fine. Did he know something she didn’t?\n The Doctor turned to Owen. “Mr. Vance, I’m sorry, but could you excuse us, please?”\n Owen nodded. “Of course, Doctor,” he said. “I’m glad you’re alright,” he told Lucy.\n She saw the sincerity in his eyes, and it surprised her. She wondered if she hadn’t been too hard on him before. It was obvious she was attracted to the security officer, so why did she have to make things complicated?\n Owen turned and headed towards the doors. Lucy called, “Hey Owen.” He paused and looked back at her. Lucy smiled warmly at him. “Thanks for visiting me,” she said.\n Owen’s eyes grew a little wider. He flashed an uncertain smile and nodded, then left the sickbay.\n Lucy returned her attention to the Doctor, who was studying her face like a bug under a magnifying glass.\n “Ensign, are you aware that your skin pigmentation is changing?” he said.\n “Huh?” said Lucy. Her hand rose to her cheek. “You mean I’m blushing?”\n The Doctor shook his head. “No, that’s not what I mean.”\n Lucy looked from the Doctor to Kes, who was squinting at Lucy’s face now, too. “Your lips are reddening,” she said.\n “Really?” said Lucy. Her fingers moved to her lips. “That’s weird…”\n Kes stood and crossed the sickbay, apparently looking for something.

{"id": 12, "text": "“Ensign Kang, are you aware of any… out of the ordinary sensations? Any pain or discomfort, anywhere in your body?”\n Lucy shifted her hips and rolled her shoulders, gauging her senses. “No, Doctor. I told you, I’m fine.”\n “You’re not experiencing any nausea? No trembling? No sense of weakness? No fear or anxiety?”\n Lucy shook her head. “Not really…”\n The Doctor sighed. “Don’t you think that’s odd, considering what you’ve just been through?”\n Lucy shrugged. “I mean… I’m alive. That’s what matters, right?”\n The Doctor just shook his head. “Do you have any sense of what was done to you on that station?”\n Lucy considered. It was certainly not something pleasant to contemplate, but for the Doctor’s sake, she tried.\n “Well, at first, I was in a lot of pain, and I was terrified. I thought I was going to die, and what a horrible way it would have been to go.”\n Lucy felt an involuntary shudder, but it seemed out of place to her. The recollection didn’t actually bother her all that much.\n “Then… all of a sudden, the pain stopped. I was literally being stabbed all over my body and twisted around by all these strong cords, and yet, somehow, it didn’t hurt anymore. Maybe the pod used a numbing agent? And then, suddenly, I wasn’t afraid anymore. I still thought I was dying. I guess maybe I was in shock? Or I’d just accepted it as inevitable? But I wasn’t scared at all, just… inexpressibly sad. I thought I’d never get home again.”\n It was hard to convey the experience to the Doctor. It was hard to even remember what it had felt like, to be that sad. She couldn’t really find the feeling inside her anymore.\n “Then, the sadness was gone too. That was the weirdest part. Like, I felt all these slimy tubes sticking into my body, and I could feel it under my skin. I could even feel it in my head. Like something out the worst, most disgusting, horrific nightmare. And all I could gin up in reaction was this big sense of, ‘Wow, this should really be bothering me a lot more than it is.’ But I guess I was just exhausted by that point. By the time the pod let me go, I was beyond ready to just pass out.”\n Lucy’s attention returned to her current surroundings. The Doctor looked at her with compassionate eyes. Kes stood in front of her bed, clutching a hand mirror against her chest. Her face was ashen, and tears were welling up in her wide eyes. She blinked several times to clear her eyes, and then she stepped forward and handed Lucy the mirror. “Here,” she said. “I thought you’d want to see what we were talking about.” The young Ocampan hardly got the words out before she turned away. She wiped her eyes with her hands as she walked quickly to the Doctor’s office, letting the doors close behind her.\n Lucy didn’t know what to make of that reaction. She supposed the story must have been pretty upsetting to hear.\n “Are you upset, that that happened to you?” said the Doctor.\n She shook her head. “It’s over, now.”\n “Are you worried about what the lasting effects might be?”\n Lucy shrugged. “A little, maybe.”\n “And you aren’t in any pain.”\n “I told you, no. Why do you keep asking that?”\n The Doctor took a deep breath. “Ensign Kang… Lucy… currently, inside of your body, there are fifteen biosynthetic constructs of alien design, with countless threads branching out through all of your major organs. They’re already fully integrated with your biology. I can’t remove them. And they’re… changing you.”\n “Wow, that’s… fascinating!” said Lucy. “Are they primarily organic, or do they incorporate organic tissues in an inorganic framework?”\n The Doctor’s eyebrows shot up. “I just told you your body was full of alien implants, Ensign. That isn’t the sort of reaction I was expecting.”\n Lucy reflected for a moment. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. You said they’re in every organ… that must include my brain. Do you suppose they’re changing my behavior, too?”\n The Doctor nodded. “I think that’s a safe deduction, yes,” he said.\n “Then, you must be worried that I could pose a threat to the ship,” she said. She glanced at the security officers by the doors, Crewman Jeffery Thorold and Crewman Megan Steiner. Jeffery was watching her out of the corner of his eye. When he saw her looking at him, his attention returned directly ahead.\n “Keep up the good work, Jeff, Megan,” said Lucy. “Sorry I’ve got you stuck on guard duty. I know it can be pretty dull.”\n “Ensign, would you please focus?” said the Doctor.\n Lucy was surprised at his irritation, though she supposed she shouldn’t have been.

Ensign Kim in the back looked about as green as Chakotay felt. Tuvok looked positively bored, as usual for the Vulcan. Torres was eyeing the wormhole with unwary fascination. She was obviously not prepared for the rough road that lay ahead.\n Chakotay caught her eye and flashed her an enigmatic smile that she clearly couldn’t interpret, and then they passed into the wormhole.\n A slight shimmy rattled through the spaceframe of the shuttlecraft, and then they were out on the other side. That was it. No sudden jolt to the inertial dampeners, and no abrupt torque on the shuttle’s nose cone, either.\n “What, that was it?” said Torres. “I was expecting…” She shrugged.\n Chakotay gave Lieutenant Paris a questioning look.\n “Don’t look at me, sir,” said Tom, “I only wish I could take the credit.”\n Ensign Kim consulted his console. “Variances inside of the wormhole were down in the two millicochrane range,” he said. “Telemetry suggests the wormhole spontaneously stabilized in the last seconds before we made the passage.”\n “And now, the wormhole is returning to its previous degree of instability,” Tuvok reported, consulting his own console. “It would appear that some external force acted momentarily to ensure our safe passage.”\n As Chakotay considered that bit of information, Ensign Kim ran more scans of the space surrounding the abandoned station. Lieutenant Torres tore her attention from the stunning view outside with an effort and turned her attention to her own console.\n “The power output of the station is roughly twice what it was the last time we were here, Commander,” said Ensign Kim.\n “At least,” Torres added. “And the power seems more stable and distributed around the station than what the telemetry from your last mission recorded.”\n “I guess the station’s been doing some straightening up since our last visit,” said Chakotay. He was just considering hailing the station again when his communications board lit up. \n A tone sounded from Ensign Kim’s ops console, and he announced, “Commander, we’re being hailed.”\n “I see that, Ensign,” said Chakotay, and he opened a channel with the press of a button.\n Lieutenant Paris said, “Commander, are you sure that’s such a good idea?” but it was already done.\n Chakotay just regarded Tom with a cocked eyebrow and a slight shrug.\n “Welcome, returning customers!” The voice of the station resembled the voice from the last visit in inflection and tone only. Where before it had been grating and artificial, it now sounded as clear and natural as organic speech.\n It went on, “You’ve reached the Delurididug Deep Space Travel Network and Trade Hub. Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Travel Network is currently unavailable. However, the Trade Hub is open for business! We are currently transmitting your instructions for docking.”\n Chakotay’s console received a packet of data from the station, which the computer was able to compile into a simple, graphically represented set of docking instructions. The voice from the station continued talking without pause.\n “Please be patient while those ships in queue ahead of yours finish their approaches and departures. Visitors will be cleared to dock in the same order that they arrived through the gateways.”\n Chakotay glanced around the empty space around the station and exchanged a look with Lieutenant Paris. Tom shook his head. No one else was out there.\n The automated voice went on, “All forms of faster-than-light travel and remote matter transference are prohibited inside of Hub Space. Any unwarranted act of violence or aggression against the Hub, the Network, the proprietors of the Hub, or other visitors to the Hub or Network is also prohibited. All contracts joined in good faith within the confines of Hub Space are binding. The Hub and its licensed proprietors reserve the right to withhold service from any customer for any reason. The Hub and the Network are committed to upholding the laws of the Delurididug Trade Federation, as well as the laws specific to the nationalities of each customer, subject to the limits of Trade Federation Law. The Delurididug Trade Hub is empowered by the Delurididug Trade Federation to enforce all binding contracts within the limits of Trade Federation law. Violations of binding contracts are subject to summary arbitration, and may result in confiscation of trade goods or formally recognized legal tender, expulsion from Hub Space, arrest pending trial in a Trade Federation Tribunal, or any combination of the above, subject to the judgment of the administration of the Trade Hub and within the limits of Trade Federation Law.\n “For more on the rules, regulations, and policies governing the Trade Hub Station and its surrounding space, please refer to the terms of service that are being transmitted now.” Chakotay studied his console as the computer received another data packet and compiled it into an encyclopedia-sized volume of alien legalese.\n “Tuvok, I’m sending you their rulebook. See if there’s anything in the rules about restricted areas. Maybe we can narrow down the possible locations of the computer core or their power generators, based on where they don’t want us to go. And while you’re at it, see if there’s a procedure in place for filing complaints.”\n “Aye, sir,” said Tuvok.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[36, 39, "PER"], [58, 68, "PER"], [114, 119, "PER"], [121, 127, "PER"], [133, 136, "PER"], [240, 248, "PER"], [474, 482, "PER"], [571, 581, "PER"], [619, 627, "PER"], [634, 639, "PER"], [682, 688, "SPEC"], [690, 696, "PER"], [813, 821, "PER"], [1199, 1205, "PER"], [1241, 1249, "PER"], [1255, 1271, "PER"], [1323, 1326, "PER"], [1368, 1378, "PER"], [1672, 1677, "PER"], [1809, 1817, "PER"], [1854, 1865, "PER"], [1928, 1945, "PER"], [2147, 2156, "PER"], [2164, 2174, "PER"], [2189, 2195, "PER"], [2414, 2422, "PER"], [2534, 2546, "PER"], [2579, 2588, "PER"], [2625, 2631, "PER"], [2639, 2647, "PER"], [2702, 2718, "PER"], [2726, 2735, "PER"], [2802, 2810, "PER"], [2825, 2828, "PER"], [3135, 3186, "LOC"], [3233, 3247, "LOC"], [3287, 3296, "LOC"], [3382, 3392, "PER"], [3807, 3815, "PER"], [3892, 3908, "PER"], [3910, 3913, "PER"], [4082, 4091, "LOC"], [4151, 4154, "ORG"], [4160, 4167, "ORG"], [4192, 4195, "LOC"], [4222, 4225, "LOC"], [4229, 4236, "LOC"], [4315, 4324, "LOC"], [4342, 4345, "LOC"], [4451, 4454, "ORG"], [4463, 4470, "ORG"], [4514, 4542, "ORG"], [4637, 4653, "ORG"], [4663, 4684, "ORG"], [4705, 4733, "ORG"], [4788, 4804, "ORG"], [4976, 4985, "LOC"], [5013, 5038, "ORG"], [5126, 5135, "ORG"], [5161, 5177, "ORG"], [5248, 5265, "LOC"], [5363, 5371, "PER"], [5508, 5513, "PER"], [5847, 5852, "PER"]]}
{"id": 17, "text": "“Respectfully, sir,” said Paris, “Do you really think there’s someone over there that handles complaints?”\n Chakotay shrugged. “We still don’t know the capabilities of the station, especially now that it’s regained so much function. But it’s clearly highly automated, and it seems to put a lot of value in laws and contracts. We might be able to use that to learn more about what’s happening to Ensign Kang, and hopefully, how to reverse it.”\n “You’re not seriously counting on that station to respect Federation laws, are you?” said Torres. “Our Federation, that is.”\n “I’m not counting on anything, Lieutenant,” said Chakotay, “Just exploring all options.”\n Harry shook his head, but he didn’t look up from his console.\n “Something the matter, Ensign?” said Chakotay.\n “No, sir,” said Harry. “Just… I keep thinking about Neelix’s ghost story.”\n Chakotay’s reply was interrupted by the voice of the station. “Thank you for your patience. Your vessel has been cleared to dock. We are sending you an updated flight plan to guide you to your berth. Any deviation from the flight plan is grounds to revoke your boarding privileges and move your vessel to the back of the queue. Repeated or flagrant violations may lead to expulsion from Hub Space.\n “If you prefer, you may turn over guidance to the Trade Hub guidance system, and we will guide your vessel into its berth.”\n “Fat chance,” Tom remarked.\n Chakotay’s console received the flight plan, and he sent it over to Tom. “Just stick to the flight plan, Tom. I’d hate to have to wait in that line again,” he deadpanned.\n Tom gave Chakotay a quizzical glance, and Chakotay favored him with a slight smile. \n With a smirk, Tom turned his attention back to his console and punched a series of instructions into the shuttle’s guidance system. “Aye, sir. Course laid in and plotted.”\n “Take us in,” said Chakotay.\n  \n \n  \n They entered the station through the same port as on their previous visit. Inside the bay, conditions had changed markedly. The atmosphere and gravity were the same, but the illumination had increased significantly, owing to an array of free-floating orbs of yellow-white light that hovered over the shuttle bay like little Suns, giving the space an inviting, almost Earth-like quality.\n Tom set the shuttle down exactly where the flight plan indicated and ran quickly through his power-down checklist while the rest of the crew gave their reports on the station. When they were ready, Tuvok opened the shuttle door.\n And he froze in the doorway.\n His expression betrayed no surprise or confusion, so it took a moment for Chakotay to understand why the security chief had paused in place. Chakotay looked out through the door and found a man standing in the docking bay at the bottom of the shuttle’s shallow ramp, hands spread wide in greeting.\n He looked human, with dusky but not dark features, slightly wavy, short, dark brown hair, the barest hint of points to his ears, the slightest upward angle of his eyebrows, and deep wrinkles in the center of his forehead that might have been the beginning of a cranial ridge. He had a wide smile, and his teeth were perfectly even and dazzlingly white. And, he wore a loose-fitting, flowing three-piece outfit woven from dark gray and deep burgundy fabrics, with curious accents of hardened leather on the shoulders and forearms, as if he were trying to split the difference between a traditional Terran suit, a Vulcan dignitary robe, and ceremonial Klingon armor.\n Tuvok overcame his momentary surprise and brought his tricorder to bear on the stranger.\n “Welcome to the Delurididug Trade Hub,” said the stranger. “I’m your host and point of contact for all of your questions and concerns regarding the station. You can call me Hux.”\n “It’s a projection, sir,” said Tuvok.\n Hux’s smile grew even wider. “Well spotted, Lieutenant!” he said. “When your party is all prepared, I can lead you to any of the publicly available levels of the station.” Turning to Chakotay, he said, “Tell me, how long can we expect to have the pleasure of your company, Commander…”\n “Chakotay,” said Chakotay. He was quietly impressed that the projection was apparently able to read and interpret his provisional rank insignia. Clearly, the station had gathered quite a bit of information on its deep dive through the shuttle’s computer core. He wondered if it didn’t already know each of their names, and was only letting him introduce himself as a matter of politeness.\n Remembering the projection had asked him a question, Chakotay added, “I’m not sure. It will depend on… how we might be able to help each other.”\n Hux nodded. “I look forward to discussing that with you. For now, let’s adjourn to a reception area, shall we?”\n Chakotay glanced back at his away team and verified that they were all ready to proceed.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[26, 31, "PER"], [108, 116, "PER"], [395, 406, "PER"], [502, 512, "GPE"], [547, 557, "GPE"], [601, 611, "PER"], [534, 540, "PER"], [619, 627, "PER"], [660, 665, "PER"], [746, 752, "PER"], [760, 768, "PER"], [787, 792, "PER"], [823, 831, "PER"], [847, 857, "PER"], [1234, 1243, "LOC"], [1296, 1305, "ORG"], [1400, 1410, "PER"], [1468, 1471, "PER"], [1505, 1508, "PER"], [1572, 1575, "PER"], [1581, 1589, "PER"], [1614, 1622, "PER"], [1672, 1675, "PER"], [1850, 1858, "PER"], [2236, 2241, "LOC"], [2257, 2260, "PER"], [2455, 2460, "PER"], [2591, 2599, "PER"], [2622, 2636, "PER"], [2658, 2666, "PER"], [2727, 2738, "LOC"], [2826, 2831, "SPEC"], [3413, 3419, "LOC"], [3428, 3434, "SPEC"], [3466, 3473, "SPEC"], [3482, 3487, "PER"], [3588, 3609, "LOC"], [3745, 3748, "PER"], [3783, 3788, "PER"], [3791, 3796, "PER"], [3835, 3845, "PER"], [3974, 3982, "PER"], [4064, 4073, "PER"], [4078, 4086, "PER"], [4094, 4102, "PER"], [4520, 4528, "PER"], [4613, 4616, "PER"], [4726, 4734, "PER"]]}
{"id": 18, "text": "“Lead the way,” he said.\n Hux led the away team towards the doors at the edge of the docking bay. Chakotay was gratified to see that his officers instinctively arrayed themselves in a rough pentagon, tricorders out and scanning their surroundings, phasers holstered but charged. No one needed to be reminded that they were still boarding a dangerous and unpredictable relic of an ancient and powerful civilization, regardless of the warm welcome they’d received thus far.\n When they reached the doorway, Hux stopped and addressed the party.\n “Now, those of you who have visited the Hub in the past are no doubt familiar with the scanner up ahead. For the rest of you, there’s no cause for alarm. The scanner is completely harmless. It provides the Trade Hub with a set of individualized biometrics in order to tailor our services for each individual. It’s also a security feature. The scanner will catalog your sidearms and any other self-defense implements on your person, as well as any hazardous materials you might be carrying. \n “Now, before you start to worry, allow me to reassure you that the Trade Hub does not make a habit of confiscating instruments of self-defense. However, we do employ a wide variety of neutralizing countermeasures in the event of accidental discharges or attempts at violence between guests. Your safety is among our highest priorities. If there are any questions about that, I’d be happy to answer them.”\n The others looked to Chakotay, and Hux seemed to follow their lead.\n Chakotay supposed it was a safe bet that the station was familiar with their phasers, seeing as it seemed to know everything else about them. He supposed there was no point in playing his cards close to his chest.\n “My away team is equipped with phased nadion beam weapons, calibrated to stun an attacker with non-lethal force. The Trade Hub won’t interfere with their functioning?”\n “Ah! Phasers are a classic, tried-and-true instrument of choice for a civilized society. And with a stun setting functionality! I applaud you on your choice. Humane, non-lethal weapons are truly a distinction of an advanced culture. \n “Of course, the Trade Hub will not interfere with the operation of your weapons. However, if any of them should happen to discharge during your stay in the Trade Hub, our countermeasures will neutralize their effect. The only exception is in the highly unlikely event that a rogue actor somehow manages to circumvent station security and take aggressive actions against members of your party. In such a case, the Trade Hub will not interfere in your legally recognized right to defend yourselves. However, any collateral damage that you might incur in such an event will need to be settled before you depart.”\n Chakotay nodded his understanding. “We’re also carrying subspace transceivers and general purpose handheld scanners. These will also be allowed to operate without interference?”\n “Of course!” said Hux, “So long as your instruments aren’t used to violate Trade Hub regulations or terms of service, we will not interfere with their operation in any way. Now, are there any more questions?”\n Chakotay glanced at the other members of the away team, inviting them to speak up if they could think of anything else to ask.\n “No?” said Hux, “Excellent. Let’s proceed.”\n The projection passed through the doorway. Chakotay waved Tuvok through, and the familiar light show flashed over him as he passed. Chakotay followed after, and the others followed him through, one at a time.\n When they were all through, Hux addressed the away team. “Now then, where would you like to begin? I regret that the inoperable state of the Travel Network has left the Trade Hub with a shortage of licensed vendors, but the Trade Hub still provides innumerable automated services and unique goods of sale that I guarantee, you will not find anywhere else in the galaxy. Based on your consumer history, can I suggest we proceed to the Aug-Tech Parlor, first?”\n Chakotay exchanged nonplussed expressions Tom and B’elanna.\n “What’s that?” said Chakotay.\n “Aug-Tech? Why, it’s our line of trademarked, consumer-grade, biosynthetic augmentation technologies, of course!”\n “Is that where we went on our previous visit?” said Chakotay.\n “Why, yes. Are you interested in augmenting another member of your party? Or perhaps you’re interested in purchasing one of our Aug-Tech augments for your crew? They’re highly customizable, able to fill a vast array of functions with greater efficiency than you’ve ever dreamed possible. Whether you’re in need of soldiers, technicians, recreational specialists…” He finished with a wink, making it all-too-clear what kind of ‘recreation’ he was referring to.\n Chakotay tasted bile. With effort, he restrained his anger.\n “Now, hold on!” said Lieutenant Torres. The same outrage that Chakotay felt was clear on the half-Klingon engineer’s face. Chakotay held up his hand to forestall an imminent outburst. Torres met his eyes and nodded her understanding.\n “Explain these augments to me, please,” said Chakotay.\n “Could you specify?” said Hux, “What exactly would you like me to explain?”\n “Are your augments living, sentient beings? Do they have any rights at all, or are they just… slaves?”\n Hux seemed confused by the question for just a moment before realization dawned. “Ah. I see your confusion,” said Hux. “It seems such practices are illegal in your civilization.”\n Chakotay nodded. “Yes, they certainly are.”\n “Hm. Well then, I’m afraid we can’t sell you any augments after all. It is the policy of the Hub never to facilitate activities that are classified as unlawful in the civilizations of our guests, you see. I’m terribly sorry if that poses any inconvenience.”\n “What if we wished to secure the freedom of your augments?” said Chakotay.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[26, 29, "PER"], [85, 96, "LOC"], [98, 106, "PER"], [504, 507, "PER"], [582, 585, "LOC"], [748, 757, "ORG"], [1101, 1110, "ORG"], [1461, 1469, "PER"], [1475, 1478, "PER"], [1509, 1517, "PER"], [1841, 1850, "ORG"], [2144, 2153, "ORG"], [2284, 2293, "LOC"], [2541, 2550, "ORG"], [2739, 2747, "PER"], [2936, 2939, "PER"], [2993, 3002, "ORG"], [3128, 3136, "PER"], [3267, 3270, "PER"], [3344, 3352, "PER"], [3359, 3364, "PER"], [3433, 3441, "PER"], [3539, 3542, "PER"], [3680, 3689, "ORG"], [3735, 3744, "ORG"], [3945, 3960, "LOC"], [3971, 3979, "PER"], [4013, 4016, "PER"], [4021, 4029, "PER"], [4052, 4060, "PER"], [4230, 4238, "PER"], [4702, 4710, "PER"], [4784, 4801, "PER"], [4825, 4833, "PER"], [4861, 4868, "SPEC"], [4886, 4894, "PER"], [4947, 4953, "PER"], [5043, 5051, "PER"], [5080, 5083, "PER"], [5235, 5238, "PER"], [5349, 5352, "PER"], [5415, 5423, "PER"], [5553, 5556, "PER"], [5784, 5792, "PER"]]}
{"id": 19, "text": "CHAPTER 6\n “Zut! That test was absolute merde!” said Lucy. She was still enjoying her newfound grasp of twentieth-century French. She’d studied Vulcan and Tellar languages in the Academy just to meet the core requirements, but she never really had a good head for languages. And besides, the universal translator was simply too convenient of a shortcut to even bother. She would have been hard pressed, these days, to recall even the more salient Tellarite curse words. But now, French invectives were free-flowing.\n “Whoever wrote that program can brûle en l’enfer! And what are you laughing at, Owen?”\n She whirled about on the security officer who was escorting her back to sickbay.\n Owen pinched his lips tight, trying to hide his mirth and failing. The other security officer, Crewman DeVries, subtly distanced himself from Owen, leaving him to bear the brunt of Lucy’s wrath.\n “Is it funny to you, that the Doctor is going to judge my fitness as a Starfleet officer on the outcome of a badly written holodeck melodrama?”\n After a promising start, the atmospheric Roma carnival setting had dissolved into chaos. A series of contrived plot twists revealed that half the food vendors were actually terrorists. They locked down the fairgrounds and rounded up as many hostages as they could get their hands on. Of course, the task of rescuing everyone fell almost immediately on Lucy. There was never a satisfactory reason given for this. She was simply a stranger in their midst that everyone decided to turn to for leadership. \n By this point, Lucy strongly suspected that someone had taken a beautifully crafted holodeck worldspace and overwritten it with the plot of a haphazard, clichéd action/adventure novel.\n Owen shook his head. “No. You’re right. The Doctor’s program was… merde.” He struggled and failed to hold in a smile.\n “Then what’s so funny?” Lucy shouted.\n “Nothing,” said Owen. “It’s just… nice to see you getting angry.”\n “What?” said Lucy. She shook her head in bewilderment. “Why?”\n “Just…” Owen cast a glance at Bobby DeVries, and lowered his voice to near-inaudibility. “Since what happened… You haven’t once gotten upset about anything.”\n Lucy blinked. “So what?”\n “So it was a really upsetting thing that happened!” he said. “I just… I don’t know if you’re in denial about it or what, but…”\n DeVries cleared his throat, bringing Owen up short.\n “Sorry,” said Owen, “I’m not supposed to talk about that. Let’s just get back to sickbay, ok?”\n Lucy didn’t move. “I’m not in denial,” she said. “I know what was done to me. I feel it, even now. But the worst is long over. I understand why everyone has their doubts, but I wish people would listen to me when I say I’m fine!”\n Owen sighed. “Well, good. I’m glad you’re ok. But I can’t help worrying about you, Lucy.”\n She almost asked “Why,” but the look on his face drew her up short. His concerns were etched into the lines around his ice-blue eyes, and deeper emotions seemed to dwell just under the surface of his gaze.\n Suddenly, Lucy didn’t know what to say. She stared into his eyes for a long moment, looking for a clearer sign of what he was thinking.\n Bobby cleared his throat again.\n Owen cast an annoyed glance at his colleague, then looked back at Lucy. “Your eyes are changing again,” he said.\n “Oh?” said Lucy. “Now what are they doing?”\n Owen smiled. “They’re going back to normal. They’re dark brown again, and the makeup is fading, too.”\n Lucy was relieved to hear it. She glanced down at her arms and saw her porcelain pallor was returning to its natural, olive tones. “Good,” she said.\n Another beat of silence passed, and suddenly it felt awkward.\n “Well, the Doctor’s going to start wondering where we are,” said Owen.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[53, 57, "PER"], [144, 150, "SPEC"], [155, 161, "SPEC"], [179, 186, "ORG"], [447, 456, "SPEC"], [597, 601, "PER"], [677, 684, "LOC"], [687, 691, "PER"], [782, 797, "PER"], [829, 833, "PER"], [868, 874, "PER"], [913, 919, "PER"], [954, 963, "ORG"], [1380, 1384, "PER"], [1547, 1551, "PER"], [1718, 1722, "PER"], [1616, 1624, "LOC"], [1006, 1014, "LOC"], [1762, 1770, "PER"], [1861, 1865, "PER"], [1892, 1896, "PER"], [1956, 1960, "PER"], [2014, 2018, "PER"], [2036, 2049, "PER"], [2165, 2169, "PER"], [2319, 2326, "PER"], [2356, 2360, "PER"], [2386, 2390, "PER"], [2453, 2460, "LOC"], [2468, 2472, "PER"], [2699, 2703, "PER"], [2782, 2786, "PER"], [3007, 3011, "PER"], [3134, 3139, "PER"], [3167, 3171, "PER"], [3233, 3237, "PER"], [3292, 3296, "PER"], [3326, 3330, "PER"], [3429, 3433, "PER"], [3653, 3661, "PER"], [3707, 3711, "PER"]]}
{"id": 20, "text": "“Right,” said Lucy. “Let’s go.” She turned around to head towards sickbay, but at the mention of the Doctor, she remembered the bloodbath that the holonovel had become, and her anger returned in force. “But I swear, if he tries to blame me for the outcome of that terrible program…”\n “I’ll vouch for you,” said Owen. He put a comforting hand on her shoulder, and soothing warmth seemed to suffuse her body from the touch, working wonders for her temper. She was halfway tempted to put her hand over his until he began gently pushing, trying to urge her back into motion. “You did everything that could be expected from a junior science officer.”\n The way he qualified his statement rubbed Lucy the wrong way. She pushed his hand away and turned on him again. “What, you think you could have done better?” she challenged.\n Owen just pointed down the corridor towards sickbay.\n “Hmpf,” said Lucy, and she turned around and marched the rest of the way to sickbay without looking back.\n  \n \n  \n “I’m sorry, Ensign, I can’t clear you for duty yet.”\n “Why?” said Lucy, “Because I couldn’t save some of the hostages?”\n “No, that’s not it,” said the Doctor.\n They were back in the Doctor’s office, and Owen and Bobby were back to guarding the entrance to sickbay.

I tried to get into their heads. I tried to find their motivations so I could work out a peaceful resolution! Little did I know, they were all just cartoon villains! If you took me to the holodeck just to play a shoot-em-up, why even—”\n “Ensign Kang!” the Doctor shouted, and finally, Lucy broke off her tirade. “Your performance in that… ‘two-bit hack holonovel’ that I wrote…” \n Lucy cringed. \n “…is not the issue. The goal was never to judge you by the outcome of the scenario, but to assess your mental condition by your behavior under unfamiliar and stressful circumstances.”\n Lucy absorbed this fact and struggled to process it. “Is this because I bought a hat, then?”\n The Doctor sighed. “No. It was not any single decision or mistake that you made.”\n “Then please, Doctor,” said Lucy, “explain it to me. I really can’t understand.”\n The Doctor paused to consider. “And how does that make you feel?”\n “Upset,” said Lucy.\n “Upset how?” said the Doctor. “Does it make you sad? Or are you afraid for your career? Your future?”\n “No,” said Lucy, “I’m angry, and I’m frustrated. I had a goal. I was supposed to save those hostages, but it was a total Kobayashi Maru. The only way to break the stalemate would have been to start killing terrorists.”\n “And did that ever cross your mind as a legitimate option?” said the Doctor.\n “Not for a moment,” said Lucy. “Even if we could have killed them all with zero collateral damage, which I highly doubt, and in spite of the fact I didn’t agree with their methods or their goals, it wasn’t my place to pick sides in their conflict. It was a classic Prime Directive scenario.”\n The Doctor paused, momentarily considering her point. “An interesting perspective.”\n “Is that why I failed?”\n The Doctor uttered a frustrated sigh. “I told you, it was nothing specific! There was no ‘right’ answer! Ensign…” He grasped for the right words for a moment before going on, “You can’t feel pain. Your shoe melted into your foot, and you didn’t even limp. And your emotional responses are completely atypical. You showed more concern for the shoe than for your foot, and you demonstrated as much sympathy for the terrorists as for the victims.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[14, 18, "PER"], [66, 73, "LOC"], [101, 107, "PER"], [311, 315, "PER"], [621, 643, "PER"], [689, 693, "PER"], [822, 826, "PER"], [866, 873, "LOC"], [889, 893, "PER"], [952, 959, "LOC"], [1003, 1009, "PER"], [1057, 1061, "PER"], [1142, 1148, "PER"], [1173, 1188, "LOC"], [1194, 1198, "PER"], [1203, 1208, "PER"], [1265, 1269, "PER"], [1278, 1284, "PER"], [1347, 1351, "PER"], [1361, 1375, "PER"], [1477, 1483, "PER"], [1512, 1516, "PER"], [1809, 1817, "LOC"], [1859, 1870, "PER"], [1877, 1883, "PER"], [1906, 1910, "PER"], [2002, 2006, "PER"], [2203, 2207, "PER"], [2301, 2307, "PER"], [2394, 2400, "PER"], [2408, 2412, "PER"], [2466, 2472, "PER"], [2543, 2547, "PER"], [2572, 2578, "PER"], [2664, 2668, "PER"], [2774, 2788, "SHIP"], [2942, 2948, "PER"], [2976, 2980, "PER"], [3248, 3254, "PER"], [3358, 3364, "PER"], [3459, 3465, "PER"]]}
{"id": 21, "text": "“I was mediating!” Lucy retorted, but the Doctor went on regardless.\n “You approached them without even trying to work out out a contingency plan or find a weapon for self-defense. They could have shot you where you stood just to make a point!”\n “They were scared!” said Lucy. “They needed someone to hear their demands, or they would have started killing hostages even sooner. Your writing made it obvious that I was the one that would be expected to step forward, so I did. I was just following the plot.”\n “As you saw it, perhaps,” said the Doctor. “But the most serious problem had nothing to do with your choices or your emotions. Ensign, your biosynthetic implants just dropped the entire French language into your head, and you didn’t skip a beat. You hardly even noticed, until I pointed it out. That degree of cognitive synergy speaks to the profound extent to which an unknown alien artificial intelligence has insinuated itself into your brain.”\n “What?” said Lucy. “You don’t think I’m Lucy Kang anymore? What am I then, a Borg?”\n “You’re still you,” said the Doctor, his voice much softer than before. “You’re still Lucille Kang. Your capacity for empathy, your cleverness, your wit, that’s all you. But you’re something more, now, too. That’s what frightens me.”\n “Well then, how long is it going to take, to prove I can be trusted again?” said Lucy.\n The Doctor shook his head. “Hopefully, we won’t have to deal with that. Commander Chakotay is back on that station right now, looking for a way to reverse what was done to you.”\n Lucy tasted something bitter. “Why didn’t anyone tell me?” she said.\n “You’re right, I should have,” said the Doctor. “I was preoccupied with setting up your assessment.”\n Lucy shook her head. “You’re not the only person who could have let me know. The Captain, or Chakotay, or anyone on the senior staff could have told me what they intended to do. I’m just an afterthought in all this, aren’t I?”\n “Far from it, Ensign,” said the Doctor.\n “But what if the cure is just as grisly and invasive as the cause? Will they even ask my permission, or will they just order me to hop back into that pod?”\n “Ensign…”\n Lucy shook her head. “They didn’t even give me a chance, did they? They saw I looked different, they saw I acted different, and immediately they just assumed they had to ‘turn me back’ somehow. I can’t even imagine what that would be like, Doctor! All this trauma and misery that people keep expecting me to feel? Why would I want that?”\n The Doctor looked perplexed. “You don’t want to be… you again, Lucy?”\n “I am me, Doctor! You said it yourself! I’m me, and I’m more! And your bogus test is a far cry from convincing me that that’s a bad thing.”\n The Doctor’s confusion faded, giving rise to a carefully neutral expression. “I’ll be sure to pass that sentiment on to the Captain, then,” he said.\n “Well… good!” said Lucy. “I’m a member of this crew, dammit. I deserve to be heard.”\n The Doctor nodded. “Of course.”\n With that settled, Lucy walked out of the Doctor’s office and back into sickbay. “So, what am I supposed to do now? Sit on a biobed and twiddle my thumbs?”\n The Doctor shook his head. “Your security clearances are still on hold, but you’re clear to visit all unrestricted areas of the ship. You’ll have two security personnel with you at all times outside of your quarters, and your activities will be monitored.”\n Lucy opened her mouth to complain, but the Doctor cut her off. \n “Those are the captain’s orders. Furthermore, you’re to report back to sickbay at oh-seven-hundred hours for a complete medical assessment, so I can monitor the progression of your condition. And keep me informed of any new symptoms you may experience in the meantime. Those are my orders. Are we clear, Ensign?”\n “Yes, Doctor,” said Lucy, making every effort to stifle her resentment. As stacked as the test had seemed, she had to acknowledge that the Doctor knew what he was doing. Whether she agreed with him or not, his judgment must have had some merit, at least from a certain point of view. Continuing to belabor the point would only serve to reinforce his conclusions.\n Lucy turned to the sickbay doors and walked straight through, studiously avoiding eye contact with Owen or Bobby as she passed between them. Without looking back, she knew they had followed her through the door by their soft footsteps on the carpeted deck.\n Lucy pondered what to do with the rest of her day. She couldn’t even enter the BNG labs without her security clearances. She found it a little absurd that she would even contemplate visiting her workplace on a day off, and yet, she yearned to do just that. Voyager only had a couple other technicians that were even qualified to do her job, and they would both be pulling extra shifts for the foreseeable future to cover for her absence. Even if she couldn’t take on any of the work, she would have liked to check in on them and offer some moral support. Maybe she could catch up with Raeger or Kigon in the commissary later to see if they could use any work advice or moral support, but right now they were sure to be in the middle of a shift or deep in a sleep cycle.\n She wasn’t hungry, so there was no reason to visit the commissary right now. She was absolutely sick of holograms, so obviously the Holodeck was out of the question. Lucy supposed she might as well just return to her quarters.\n Crewman Jarvin passed Lucy in the corridor. His step faltered when he saw her, and his eyes darted over her several times.\n “Something the matter, Crewman?” said Lucy.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[19, 23, "PER"], [42, 48, "PER"], [271, 275, "PER"], [544, 550, "PER"], [636, 642, "PER"], [971, 975, "PER"], [998, 1007, "PER"], [1035, 1039, "SPEC"], [1072, 1078, "PER"], [1129, 1141, "PER"], [1359, 1363, "PER"], [1370, 1376, "PER"], [1438, 1456, "PER"], [1545, 1549, "PER"], [1655, 1661, "PER"], [1717, 1721, "PER"], [1798, 1805, "PER"], [1810, 1818, "PER"], [1959, 1965, "PER"], [1977, 1983, "PER"], [2144, 2150, "PER"], [2154, 2158, "PER"], [2394, 2400, "PER"], [2497, 2503, "PER"], [2556, 2560, "PER"], [2574, 2580, "PER"], [2709, 2717, "PER"], [2829, 2836, "PER"], [2874, 2878, "PER"], [2945, 2951, "PER"], [2993, 2997, "PER"], [3016, 3024, "PER"], [3046, 3053, "LOC"], [3135, 3141, "PER"], [3389, 3393, "PER"], [3432, 3438, "PER"], [3469, 3478, "PER"], [3525, 3532, "LOC"], [3758, 3764, "PER"], [3774, 3780, "PER"], [3788, 3792, "PER"], [3907, 3913, "PER"], [4132, 4136, "PER"], [4151, 4158, "LOC"], [4231, 4235, "PER"], [4239, 4244, "PER"], [4390, 4394, "PER"], [4469, 4477, "LOC"], [4647, 4654, "SHIP"], [4975, 4981, "PER"], [4985, 4990, "PER"], [4998, 5008, "LOC"], [5293, 5301, "LOC"], [5327, 5331, "PER"], [5389, 5403, "PER"], [5411, 5415, "PER"], [5536, 5543, "PER"], [5551, 5555, "PER"]]}
{"id": 22, "text": "CHAPTER 7\n “I say we fly Voyager in there and ram a few photon torpedoes up their aft ventral porthole! See how they like that!” Lieutenant Torres raged. \n The senior staff was gathered in the conference room, minus Chakotay, who was still being held captive on the space station. They hadn’t been sitting at the conference table more than a couple minutes before Torres was back on her feet, though, pacing back and forth down the length of the table.\n Janeway regarded the hot-headed engineer patiently, deciding it would be better just to let Torres vent her frustrations and get it out of the way. After all, she was just giving voice to the frustration that pervaded the whole room. They were angry, and they were worried for Chakotay, and everyone needed to acknowledge it—everyone but Tuvok, of course.\n  “The Delurididug Trade Hub holds significant strategic advantages over Voyager,” he Vulcan-splained. “It exists within an isolated region of space, over which it appears to control both ingress and egress. It has far more advanced technology than Voyager, it generates far more power than Voyager, and its immense bulk likely hides defensive systems significantly more formidable than Voyager’s. Such a confrontation is unlikely to end in our favor.”\n Torres waved off his objection. “We don’t even know if the station is armed. We scanned every inch of it, and I didn’t see an operational weapons system.”\n “Indeed,” said Tuvok, “We have been able to discern very little about key functions on the station. We cannot identify a computer core, a power source, or any form of warp field generator. And yet, we have ample evidence that the station has each of these systems. Therefore, the station is either employing technology so foreign and advanced that we cannot recognize it, or it is somehow disguising these systems from our scans. The same could go for weapons.”\n B’elanna shook her head. “It’s unmanned. Whatever advanced technology may or may not be on board is useless if no one is there to operate it.”\n Tuvok arched an eyebrow. “Is it your contention that the A.I. of the station is incapable of autonomous self-defense?”\n B’elanna looked uncertain for a moment. Then she threw her hands up and plopped herself back into her chair. “Oh, how the hell should I know?” she said.\n Tuvok nodded. “Well put, Lieutenant,” he said. “We do not know enough at this time to justify putting Voyager at risk.”\n “So what, then?” said Torres, “Do we abandon Commander Chakotay? Or do we play along? Throw ourselves on the mercy of a long-defunct court and the judgment of a malfunctioning hologram?”\n “Whether or not we take that course should depend on the laws of the court in question. I am still in the process of familiarizing myself with the Delurididug legal code. It is a curious system of governance; a technocratic meritocracy, its laws rigid, yet robust; idiosyncratic, yet imminently logical. Once we have an adequate understanding of their laws, we may be able to formulate an effective defense for Commander Chakotay.”\n “And what if we can’t?” said Harry. “What if we don’t have a case? Then what do we do?”\n “Maybe we can plan a jailbreak,” said Tom.\n “I would calculate our odds of securing Commander Chakotay’s escape as less than one point five percent, given their ability to neutralize our weapons inside of the station,” said Tuvok.\n “And even if we manage to pull it off, we can forget about getting a wormhole to the Federation,” said Harry, “Or curing Ensign Kang.”\n “I’m afraid there are other hurdles where Ensign Kang is concerned,” said the Doctor.\n The others turned to the wall monitor that displayed the Doctor’s image.\n “What’s the status of your patient, Doctor?” said Captain Janeway.\n The Doctor took a moment to consider his response. “Well, physically, her condition is downright superhuman. I’ve been monitoring her vitals and activities remotely since she left sickbay. She spent an hour in the deck eight gymnasium, during which time she performed a complete calisthenics routine at three times standard gravity, ran twenty-five kilometers, and burned over four thousand calories. Her pulse never exceeded one hundred twenty beats a minute, and as far as I can tell from remote sensors, there was none of the lactic acid buildup in her tissues that such a strenuous workout should have produced. Afterward, she ordered an eighteen hundred calorie meal from her personal replicator, and at last check, she appeared to be sleeping. I’ll be able to tell you more about her physical condition in the morning, after her next physical.\n “Psychologically… The results of my assessment were deeply ambiguous. Her problem-solving abilities are excellent, but prior testing suggests this is a pre-existing trait. Her regard for life and her empathic instincts are very strong, but by the same token, her capacity for emotional detachment is lacking. Again, this matches the results of her prior psychological assessments. In these regards, her personality is essentially intact.\n “One item of concern is her lack of cautious reflexes. If she saw a snake by her foot, for instance, she would not jump away from it on instinct. She would register the snake, decide consciously if it were a threat, and reason out an appropriate reaction. By the time she decided what to do, the snake might have already bitten her ankle. Her power of reasoning is excellent, but in emotionally fraught and emergent situations, I’m afraid this cognitive deficit will present a powerful liability.\n “Of even greater concern are the cognitive enhancements that she has begun demonstrating. During the assessment, I chose to deprive the ensign of her universal translator. Seeing as many of the characters in the program spoke only 20th Century French, I thought this would provide an additional challenge. Instead, the ensign learned a new language, fluently, in a matter of minutes—just by being in the presence of people speaking it. The implants are certainly interacting with her brain, providing cognitive enhancements in specialized tasks like language acquisition. As to any other ways they may be affecting her cognition, I can’t yet say.\n “But what concerns me most of all is that the ensign is starting to show a strong reticence towards the notion of reversing her condition.”\n There was a beat of quiet around the conference table as the staff absorbed the Doctor’s meaning. Evidently, none of the others had considered that Ensign Kang might not want to be cured.\n “Well, I guess I can’t really blame her,” said Tom.\n The others all looked at Tom, and he sat forward in his chair.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[25, 32, "SHIP"], [129, 146, "PER"], [216, 224, "PER"], [364, 370, "PER"], [454, 461, "PER"], [546, 552, "PER"], [731, 739, "PER"], [792, 797, "PER"], [817, 838, "LOC"], [883, 890, "SHIP"], [896, 902, "SPEC"], [1059, 1066, "SHIP"], [1101, 1108, "SHIP"], [1197, 1206, "SHIP"], [1264, 1270, "PER"], [1323, 1330, "LOC"], [1435, 1440, "PER"], [1883, 1891, "PER"], [2027, 2032, "PER"], [2147, 2155, "PER"], [2301, 2306, "PER"], [2326, 2336, "PER"], [2403, 2410, "SHIP"], [2444, 2450, "PER"], [2467, 2485, "PER"], [2757, 2768, "SPEC"], [3021, 3039, "PER"], [3072, 3077, "PER"], [3170, 3173, "PER"], [3216, 3236, "PER"], [3356, 3361, "PER"], [3467, 3472, "PER"], [3449, 3459, "LOC"], [3485, 3496, "PER"], [3542, 3553, "PER"], [3578, 3584, "PER"], [3644, 3652, "PER"], [3697, 3703, "PER"], [3711, 3726, "PER"], [3733, 3739, "PER"], [3909, 3916, "LOC"], [5188, 5193, "SPEC"], [5087, 5092, "SPEC"], [5315, 5320, "SPEC"], [5653, 5659, "PER"], [5836, 5842, "PER"], [6211, 6217, "PER"], [6386, 6394, "PER"], [6454, 6465, "PER"], [6542, 6545, "PER"], [6573, 6576, "PER"]]}
{"id": 23, "text": "“Hey, she’s got superpowers,” he said. “She’s faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.”\n Tuvok’s eyebrow crawled about halfway up his scalp.\n “Figuratively, I mean,” said Tom. “And she’s unrestrained by negative emotions. That sounds like it would be hard to give up.”\n “Actually,” said the Doctor, “She has quite a few negative emotions. Unfortunately, without the ability to express sorrow about her circumstances, her emotional release seems to come primarily in the form of anger. She’s resentful, Captain. She feels she should have been consulted before Commander Chakotay led a risky away mission on her behalf. She resents being treated with suspicion and kept from resuming her post. So far, her reason and her sense of empathy seem to be working to defuse her anger, but I’m not convinced it will last.”\n Janeway nodded to the Doctor. “Well, for what it’s worth, I think she has a point,” she said. Then she addressed the room. \n “Torres, Kim, get to work analyzing all the data we have on the structure of the station. We need to learn as much as we can about its external hardpoints and its internal structure. Paris, get with Lieutenant Ayala and start on that jailbreak scenario. \n “Tuvok, I’ll need you sorting out their laws and devising our case. Gather all the help you need, from any department. \n “If we can beat their legal system, we will. If we can’t, we go with a jailbreak. And in case that fails, Torres, Kim… once we know everything we possibly can about that station, start working on a way to cripple it. Once we have the upper hand, maybe the station will listen to reason. But that’s our last resort.\n “Does anyone have questions?”\n “What about Ensign Kang, sir?” said the Doctor.\n Janeway rested her chin on her hand a moment, her gaze far away, as she considered the problem. “That is the question, isn’t it?” Finally, she braced her hands against the table and pushed herself up to her feet. “I think it’s time I paid her a visit. Now, let’s get to work, people. You’re dismissed.”\n  \n \n  \n Lucy writhed languidly against the silky fabric of her bedsheets, reveling in the afterglow. Owen rested his head on his hands and stared up at the deckhead, an easy, almost sedated smile on his face. She rolled over to face him, propping herself up on her elbow.\n He cast a sidelong glance her way, and she quirked a questioning eyebrow. He reached out and ran his hand through her hair just above her left ear, gently massaging her scalp with his fingertips.\n “Are you petting me like a dog right now?” said Lucy, although she made no move to stop him. His touch sent happy shivers through her whole body.\n “Just making sure you’re not secretly a Deltan,” said Owen.\n Lucy gave a breathy chuckle. “Why, because you’re afraid my lovemaking has left you incurably insane? Or is it because my hair looks like a wig?” Deltans had a near-human aspect, minus cranial hair. They were also legendary love-makers, with passions so intense they could literally drive a human mad. Or that was the legend, at any rate. Lucy doubted it could be entirely accurate.\n “Definitely the first one,” he said.\n Lucy nearly made a pithy retort about how with her enhancements, anything was possible, but she held back—in part, because she was sick of bringing up the subject, and in part, because she realized it was true.\n “Do you think this might have been a mistake?” she said.\n Owen’s expression sobered. His hand slid from her hair to her cheek, cupping her jawline with his palm. He shook his head. “No.”\n Lucy sighed. She couldn’t help nuzzling into his hand a little bit, but she couldn’t ignore the implications of what they’d just done. She leaned back, breaking contact.\n “What if I’m contagious, somehow?” she asked.\n “The Doctor wouldn’t have let you out of sickbay,” he said.\n Lucy shrugged. “What does he know? I’m infected with technology centuries ahead of ours. The Doctor can only guess what all it can do.”\n Owen considered for a moment. “Well then, at least you won’t be going through it alone anymore.”\n Lucy rolled her eyes. “Come on, that wouldn’t make me feel any better. I’d just feel guilty for dragging you down with me.”\n “Dragging me up, you mean?

{"id": 24, "text": "“Whatever, you know what I mean.”\n “Well, either way, you’d have no reason to feel guilty. I seduced you, remember?”\n Lucy laughed. “Is that what you call insulting me, and then begging for forgiveness?”\n Owen put on a roguish smile. “That’s my trademark Vance charm.”\n He was so cute when he showed unearned confidence. Lucy leaned closer to him.\n “Oh, that’s what it is?” said Lucy. She brought her face within a couple centimeters of his. She could feel his breath on her cheek.\n “Uh huh,” he said.\n “Yeah?” she said, and she kissed him. He returned her kiss readily, and things progressed quickly from there. Soon, the world seemed to fade away around them, until nothing was left but those points where their two bodies met; hands exploring sensitive flesh, legs brushing legs, interlocking lips, conjoined hips, and nothing in between them but friction and perspiration.\n Afterward, Lucy and Owen both stared up at the deckhead. Lucy felt as blissful and sensuous as ever, but Owen was starting to doze off, his eyelids slowly drifting shut.\n Then, that same nagging doubt popped back into her mind. “Do you think the Doctor will be mad?” she said.\n Owen opened his eyes again and looked at her. “Are you going to tell him?”\n “I have another check-up first thing in the morning,” said Lucy. “I’m sure he’ll figure it out.”\n Owen’s brow furrowed. “Well, he never told you not to have sex, did he?”\n “No,” said Lucy. “But now it seems like kind of a no-brainer, right?”\n Owen shrugged. “Well, what’s done is done. I’ll report to sickbay with you and get checked over, just to be safe, ok?”\n Lucy tried to imagine the Doctor’s reaction when they confessed what they’d done. She smiled. “He’ll definitely be mad. You sure you want to be there when he finds out?”\n “Well, I wouldn’t want you to bear the brunt of it.”\n Lucy shook her head. “I’m not afraid of that.”\n “Of course not,” said Owen. “You’re not afraid of anything.”\n There was a quiet beat. Lucy realized she was getting pretty hungry. \n “You wanna get some—” \n “Sorry.”\n They’d spoken at the same time.\n “For what?” said Lucy. \n “I mean…” said Owen, and he studied her face for a second. Lucy stared back, mildly confused. What had he done this time?\n “Nothing,” said Owen. “Nevermind.”\n Lucy nodded, deciding that if Owen had stuck his foot in his mouth again and she’d missed it, then it was really for the best.\n “You wanna get some kimbap?” said Lucy.\n “What’s that?” said Owen.\n “It’s like sushi,”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[118, 122, "PER"], [205, 209, "PER"], [255, 260, "PER"], [321, 325, "PER"], [379, 383, "PER"], [889, 893, "PER"], [898, 902, "PER"], [925, 933, "LOC"], [935, 939, "PER"], [983, 987, "PER"], [1124, 1130, "PER"], [1156, 1160, "PER"], [1291, 1295, "PER"], [1330, 1336, "PER"], [1415, 1419, "PER"], [1475, 1479, "PER"], [1533, 1540, "LOC"], [1595, 1599, "PER"], [1621, 1629, "PER"], [1820, 1824, "PER"], [1890, 1894, "PER"], [1954, 1958, "PER"], [2085, 2089, "PER"], [2108, 2112, "PER"], [2152, 2156, "PER"], [2232, 2236, "PER"], [2252, 2256, "PER"], [2282, 2286, "PER"], [2414, 2418, "PER"], [2441, 2445, "PER"]]}
{"id": 25, "text": "CHAPTER 8\n Chakotay sampled a dab of protein paste and grimaced. It resembled old, plain oatmeal, congealed and devoid of flavor. Chakotay took a moment to gird himself, then he picked up the tube of paste and squeezed its contents directly into his mouth.\n “Ugh, ack.” He grabbed the water bladder he’d been provided with his meal and bit down on the valve to let the liquid free, washing down the slimy paste with three deep gulps of lukewarm water.\n “I know, putrid stuff,” said Hux. “Not that I have any direct experience, mind you, but I’ve fed similar concoctions to twelve thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two other detained visitors over the millennia, and all but one hundred and fourteen of them provided unfavorable reviews.”\n Chakotay took one more pull on the water bladder and swished it around his mouth, clearing the last bits of paste from his palate before swallowing.\n “One and a half stars,” said Chakotay. “I’ve had worse, but not by much.”\n Hux nodded thoughtfully, no doubt adding another negative review to his tally.\n “Well, it’ll keep you nourished, at any rate. The Delurididug Trade Federation does not neglect its detainees.”\n Chakotay was forced to agree. The room in which the station held him captive resembled a budget suite at a Rigelian hostel more than a holding cell. The cot in the corner was clean and reasonably comfortable, there were a table and three chairs, there was a food slot on the wall where the protein paste had materialized, and there was an interface screen on the wall, although it was off, and it had no obvious controls. A single floating orb of yellow-white light hovered near the ceiling, providing comfortable illumination for the room.\n Chakotay contemplated the depleted tube of protein paste on the table in front of him, wishing there was something else he could eat. The modest serving of paste would probably sustain him in his captivity until his shipmates returned, but it was far from filling.\n Hux took a seat opposite Chakotay at the table and leaned in, resting his illusory weight on his holographic elbows. “Would you like to try something you might find a bit more palatable?” said the projection.\n Chakotay arched an eyebrow. No doubt, it would come at a cost. It occurred to Chakotay that he still didn’t know what the Trade Hub actually traded for.\n “Unfortunately, I haven’t got any currency,” said Chakotay.\n “That’s not such a problem,” said Hux. “The Trade Hub receives many visitors who have no formal trade relations or currency exchanges with the Delurididug Trade Federation. We are more than happy to barter.”\n Chakotay sighed and sat back in his chair. “Well, I don’t have anything to barter, either. However, Voyager has stores of dilithium crystal, gold-pressed latinum, verterium cortenide…”\n Hux shook his head. “I’m sorry, but from what I can gather of your people’s technological development, I doubt you possess any kind of mineral wealth that we can’t synthesize for ourselves on the station.”\n That brought Chakotay up short. “Well… Why don’t you try me? What would you be interested in?”\n Hux looked dubious. “Crystalline benamite? Bioavailable kironide? Anti-protomatter? Polyphasic neutronium? Hexaburnium?”\n Chakotay shook his head, suddenly feeling a lot less confident that they would be able to win over the station’s cooperation through trade. He’d never even heard of a few of the things Hux listed. Still, he pushed forward. “We might be able to track down some of those things on the other side of the wormhole if you make it worth our while,” he said.\n Hux shook his head. “By the time you returned, your access point would be long gone.”\n The hairs on Chakotay’s neck rose, and he sat up in his chair. He reined himself in, though, not wanting his captor to catch him fretting. Affecting an air of nonchalance, he adjusted the sleeve of his uniform and said, “The wormhole isn’t a permanent structure? How much longer will it last?”\n Hux put his hands up in a placating gesture, as if Chakotay had exploded in panic. “It should last long enough for us to conclude our business, so long as your shipmates don’t dawdle. Maintaining the access point over the long term simply isn’t cost effective during the current Travel Network maintenance cycle, I’m afraid.”\n Chakotay considered the hologram’s words for a moment. “I’m curious, how long has the current maintenance cycle been in progress?”\n “Four thousand, one hundred and forty-one Earth years,” said Hux.\n “That can’t be right,” said Chakotay. “What kind of maintenance cycle is measured in millennia?”\n Hux shrugged. “We apologize for any inconvenience. Occasional, unforeseen delays are inevitable in eight-dimensional, sub-spatial architecture projects of this magnitude.”\n “Well, maybe there’s a way for Voyager to help you hasten your repairs.”\n Hux shook his head sadly. “I’m afraid that’s out of the question.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[11, 19, "PER"], [130, 138, "PER"], [482, 485, "PER"], [740, 748, "PER"], [919, 927, "PER"], [965, 968, "PER"], [1095, 1123, "ORG"], [1158, 1166, "PER"], [1265, 1273, "SPEC"], [1700, 1708, "PER"], [1966, 1969, "PER"], [1991, 1999, "PER"], [2176, 2184, "PER"], [2254, 2262, "PER"], [2298, 2307, "ORG"], [2380, 2388, "PER"], [2425, 2428, "PER"], [2435, 2444, "ORG"], [2534, 2562, "ORG"], [2600, 2608, "PER"], [2700, 2707, "SHIP"], [2786, 2789, "PER"], [3006, 3014, "PER"], [3089, 3092, "PER"], [3211, 3219, "PER"], [3396, 3399, "PER"], [3564, 3567, "PER"], [3664, 3674, "PER"], [3946, 3949, "PER"], [3997, 4005, "PER"], [4225, 4239, "ORG"], [4273, 4281, "PER"], [4466, 4469, "PER"], [4500, 4508, "PER"], [4570, 4573, "PER"], [4774, 4781, "SHIP"], [4817, 4820, "PER"]]}
{"id": 26, "text": "“Why?” said Chakotay. “We’ll soon have this current misunderstanding out of the way. I hope that when that’s taken care of, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship.”\n “I’m heartened to hear you say that,” said Hux. “I hope you’re right. But the workings of the Delurididug Travel Network are highly proprietary. We can’t contract third-party labor. I can’t even discuss issues of procurement with non-Delurididug parties.”\n Chakotay did his best to push down his rising frustration and disappointment. “Well, if you aren’t interested in our material wealth, and you don’t want help with your wormholes, what are you interested in?”\n “Why, intellectual property, of course!”\n “Of what sort?” said Chakotay.\n “All sorts! Charts, schematics, scientific treatises, genomic and proteomic sequences, artistic and cultural works, you name it!”\n Chakotay smiled. Voyager had detailed star charts from all four quadrants of the galaxy, a vast cultural database cataloging works from thousands of distinct civilizations, and similarly vast scientific and medical databases to match. If those were things the Delurididug valued, then the crew of Voyager was about to be VIPs. “In that case, Mr. Hux, I think we’ll be able to do business after all.”\n  \n \n  \n “I think we’ll be able to hold our own, sir,” said Lieutenant Ayala. “At least briefly. Hopefully, long enough to free Chakotay and make an emergency beam out.”\n Janeway found his confidence refreshing, if a bit over-optimistic. \n The crew had worked straight through Gamma shift on devising a strategy to deal with the space station. The captain had ordered everyone to take a four-hour rest so they could attack the problem with fresh eyes, but then the telemetry from the wormhole started showing alarming signs. The subspace distortion that defined its aperture had abruptly weakened, and when it returned, it was far less stable. The wormhole was guttering like a candle at the end of its wick. According to their best estimates, the wormhole would flicker out in four to six hours.\n The captain called this emergency briefing to learn what all her crew had come up with to this point, hoping it would be enough. \n “What makes you think you’ll be able to beam out?” said Torres. “We tried to beam Chakotay off the station before we left last time. It shrouded his comm signal and his biosigns behind some kind of dampening field.”\n “We’ll do it the same way we beamed Lopez off of Omekla III,” replied Ayala.\n Torres smiled at the memory she shared with her fellow Maquis, then translated for the benefit of the Starfleeters gathered around the conference table. “Transport enhancers,” she said. “Assembled in the field from a comm device, a tricorder, and some kind of a signal amplifier. I could modify the away team’s equipment to serve the purpose. Nothing would look out of the ordinary when they’re scanned by the station.”\n “What would you use for an amplifier?” asked Janeway.\n “The feedback converter of a compression phaser rifle should do the trick,” she said.\n “There is no way to know whether such a device would penetrate the Delurididug’s dampening field,” said Tuvok.\n “And I doubt the station is just going to stand by while you reconfigure your equipment,” said Harry.\n “That’s where frequency-modulated phaser rifles and a well-timed photonic feedback pulse come in,” said Lieutenant Paris.\n “Oh?” said Torres, her curiosity piqued. “Do tell!”\n “Based on tricorder scans from our last encounter with the station, it looks like it neutralizes our phaser fire by matching and counteracting the pulse frequency. Sound familiar?”\n “The Borg,” said Ensign Kim.\n “Exactly,” said Tom. “We think the station can identify our weapons’ firing frequency when it scans us coming onto the station, so it can adapt its countermeasures before we even fire a shot. But Starfleet has figured out a few tricks for handling Borg-style adaptive countermeasures. It’s all about modulating the phasers’ firing frequencies on the fly. If we can smuggle in a few frequency modulators, maybe disguised as data nodules or tricorder accessories, we can modify our phasers in a flash.”\n “But even if we can make use of our phasers, it’s unlikely we’ll be able to overpower the station’s defensive systems,” said Captain Janeway. “We’ve seen evidence of tractor emitters and holograms, so it’s a sure bet they’ll also have force fields, and probably automated weapons systems resistant to phaser fire.”\n Lieutenant Ayala nodded. “That’s why we’ll trigger a photonic feedback pulse,” he said. “It should destabilize holographic projectors, blind internal sensors, and disrupt confinement beams or tractor emitters in a local area, at least for a short time. We’ll need to interlink at least six tricorders with a power cell from one of our phasers, and it would probably only buy us a few seconds, but if we can use that window to disable whatever measures the station is using to detain Commander Chakotay and assemble the transport enhancers…”\n Captain Janeway began rubbing her temples with her fingertips, trying to release the tension she felt building up before it bloomed into a full-fledged headache. “So… assuming the station lets us come anywhere near the commander in the first place, and assuming the station doesn’t notice the modifications to our equipment and anticipate our tactics, and assuming the station’s systems will be vulnerable to a photonic feedback pulse, and assuming that the pulse will give us enough time to reconfigure our equipment, and assuming our phasers will be capable of disabling any remaining defenses, and assuming an improvised transport enhancer will be capable of penetrating the station’s dampening field… we’ll be home free?” she said. “Did I miss anything?”\n “Even if we are able to get Chakotay off of the station, it is unlikely that the station will allow us to escape through the wormhole,” said Tuvok.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[12, 20, "PER"], [217, 220, "PER"], [268, 294, "ORG"], [408, 419, "SPEC"], [431, 439, "PER"], [703, 711, "PER"], [845, 853, "PER"], [862, 869, "PER"], [1105, 1116, "SPEC"], [1142, 1149, "SHIP"], [1187, 1194, "PER"], [1305, 1321, "PER"], [1373, 1381, "PER"], [1416, 1423, "PER"], [2047, 2054, "PER"], [2230, 2236, "PER"], [2256, 2264, "PER"], [2427, 2432, "PER"], [2440, 2450, "LOC"], [2461, 2466, "PER"], [2469, 2475, "PER"], [2524, 2530, "ORG"], [2571, 2583, "ORG"], [2935, 2942, "PER"], [3099, 3112, "SPEC"], [3136, 3141, "PER"], [3239, 3244, "PER"], [3351, 3367, "PER"], [3381, 3387, "PER"], [3610, 3614, "SPEC"], [3622, 3632, "PER"], [3651, 3654, "PER"], [3831, 3840, "ORG"], [3883, 3887, "SPEC"], [4262, 4277, "PER"], [4453, 4469, "PER"], [4936, 4954, "PER"], [4995, 5010, "PER"], [5783, 5791, "PER"], [5896, 5901, "PER"]]}
{"id": 27, "text": "Janeway sighed. “Right. Let’s table this option for now. Ayala, Paris, you came up with some good ideas under the circumstances, but it just isn’t going to cut it.”\n Paris and Ayala exchanged a look, disappointed, but not surprised. They’d been working on this plan all night. They probably knew better than anyone all the ways it could go wrong.\n “Understood, sir,” said Lieutenant Ayala.\n Janeway nodded and moved on with the briefing. “Torres, what have you got for us?”\n Lieutenant Torres took in a deep breath, leaned in, and in a calm, serious tone, said, “Let’s ram a few photon torpedos up their aft ventral porthole, see how they like that.”\n Janeway was not amused. She regarded her chief engineer with a sober expression for a moment, then said, “So, you’ve got nothing, I take it?”\n Torres let out a frustrated sigh. “I’ve been over the scans hundreds of times. I’ve found countless sensor-invisible points all over the station. I could only spot them after mapping the station’s whole power grid and looking for points where power goes in, but not out, or out, but not in. All of the ship’s vital systems must be hidden in those points. The problem is, there are just so damned many of them, and I’ve got no way of distinguishing a… shield generator from a coffee machine. And even if we could locate a vital system, that station’s a hard nut to crack. I’ve never even seen hexaburnium in person before, but this station is plated with the stuff from bow to stern, and we have no idea what their shields will even look like if we can’t get a look at their shield generators.” \n She shook her head and sat back in her chair again. “In all seriousness, the only weak points we might feasibly exploit are the portholes along the dorsal and ventral ridges, so my initial recommendation stands. Honestly, though, Captain? We’d have better odds with a boarding party.”\n Janeway took a deep, measured breath, allowing herself a moment to come to grips with her disappointment, and turned to Tuvok. “Please tell me you have a better option, Tuvok.”\n The tactical officer nodded thoughtfully. “Under Federation law, our exploration of derelict ships and structures is protected under ‘right of salvage.’ Unfortunately, Delurididug law doesn’t acknowledge salvage rights.”\n “So, by Delurididug law, we’re guilty,” said Janeway.\n “Not necessarily,” said Tuvok. “There are certain extenuating circumstances.”\n “Such as?” Janeway prompted.\n “The last time we spoke with the A.I. of the station, it did not seem to consider itself a derelict. It seemed to believe that it was operating more or less normally, and thus it treated the away team as returning customers,” said Tuvok.\n “So then, which is it?” said Torres, “Were we trespassers, or were we customers?”\n “That is one point of contention,” said Tuvok. “If the station concludes that our party was trespassing, it will charge Chakotay with unlawful entry and larceny, the penalties for which are severe. Our only defense will be a garbled transmission that included the word ‘welcome,’ and the automated activities of the station.”\n “Oh, that’s right!” said Tom, “It did welcome us, and it opened the door, too. I don’t see how it can accuse us of trespassing after that…”\n “It was automated, though,” said Harry. “Just because a house has a welcome mat, doesn’t mean you can come in any time you like.”\n “No,” said Tom, “But if it turns on the porch light and opens the front door for you as you walk up…”\n “It amounts to a judgment call,” said Tuvok. “The A.I. may decide the garbled transmission was sufficient to act as an invitation. Or, on the contrary, it may see the garbled state of the transmission and the lack of further contact as clear indicators that the station was not operational.”\n Janeway considered his words for a moment. “Lieutenant, what’s our best bet?”\n Tuvok cleared his throat. “So long as the station regards itself as functional, we should avoid any argument contingent on the station being abandoned or derelict. Instead, we should emphasize the lack of guidance the party received on their first arrival. The party was not given the Trade Hub Terms of Service. Therefore, they cannot have violated those Terms knowingly. Also, Captain, in the Delurididug legal system, an individual is not necessarily entitled to select their own legal counsel. The only parties empowered to speak on the defendant’s behalf are the defendant himself, an agent of the tribunal, or an individual with direct legal authority over the defendant.”\n “You mean me,” said Captain Janeway.\n Tuvok nodded. Janeway would have to join the away team, or else Chakotay would be forced to plead his own case with little or no knowledge of the away team’s strategies. \n It was obviously a risk. If something went wrong, Voyager would lose her captain and her first officer in one stroke. And yet, she wouldn’t have it any other way. She was frankly relieved to have an excuse to fight for her first officer in person. \n “Tell me, Tuvok, how likely am I to win this case?” said Janeway.\n “That depends,” said Tuvok, “on whether you are willing to bring Ensign Kang to act as a witness.”\n Janeway pinched her lips, clearly not enthralled with the idea. “Say I don’t?”\n “The station may hold you in contempt and suspend the hearing until we are willing to provide the required evidence. It will keep Chakotay in detention and refuse to allow us back on board. Alternatively, the station may choose to go ahead with the hearing anyway. Our evidence will consist largely of sensor logs from our shuttle and the after action reports of the away team, both of which the station is likely to treat with suspicion. It will consider our unwillingness to surrender its technology and intellectual property as evidence of belligerence and poor character. Our odds of winning are low. And even if it sides in our favor, it will still insist we allow it to reverse Kang’s augmentations, or else to pay for services rendered.”\n “And if we do let Kang act as a witness?” said Janeway.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 7, "PER"], [57, 62, "PER"], [64, 69, "PER"], [166, 171, "PER"], [176, 181, "PER"], [372, 388, "PER"], [391, 398, "PER"], [439, 445, "PER"], [475, 492, "PER"], [652, 659, "PER"], [795, 801, "PER"], [1739, 1764, "LOC"], [1821, 1828, "PER"], [1877, 1884, "PER"], [1997, 2002, "PER"], [2046, 2051, "PER"], [2059, 2075, "PER"], [2104, 2114, "GPE"], [2223, 2234, "SPEC"], [2285, 2296, "SPEC"], [2322, 2329, "PER"], [2356, 2361, "PER"], [2422, 2429, "PER"], [2672, 2677, "PER"], [2709, 2715, "PER"], [2803, 2808, "PER"], [2883, 2891, "PER"], [3115, 3118, "PER"], [3264, 3269, "PER"], [3373, 3376, "PER"], [3503, 3508, "PER"], [3758, 3765, "PER"], [3802, 3812, "PER"], [3837, 3842, "PER"], [4122, 4131, "ORG"], [4216, 4223, "PER"], [4232, 4243, "SPEC"], [4537, 4552, "PER"], [4555, 4560, "PER"], [4569, 4576, "PER"], [4619, 4627, "PER"], [4777, 4784, "PER"], [4987, 4992, "PER"], [5034, 5041, "PER"], [5065, 5070, "PER"], [5109, 5120, "PER"], [5144, 5151, "PER"], [5354, 5362, "PER"], [5908, 5914, "PER"], [5988, 5992, "PER"], [6017, 6024, "PER"]]}
{"id": 28, "text": "CHAPTER 9\n “Good news, Commander!” said Hux. The holographic avatar of the station apparated half a meter away from Chakotay’s face, startling him out of his fretful reverie. “Your crew have returned for you!”\n “They’re here now?” said Chakotay.\n “They’ve just arrived through the Travel Network, and hardly a moment to spare. I have to confess, Chakotay, I was starting to worry for you. The operating window for that access point ends in twenty-five minutes!”\n “Can you extend that?” said Chakotay. “By the time they come on board and the hearing gets underway…” He shook his head.\n Hux considered his point for a moment. “You’re right. I’ll need to enact emergency protocols to ensure that our business is concluded in a timely fashion.”\n “Or, you could extend the window another hour!”\n Hux turned his back on Chakotay while he was still talking and faced the screen on the wall of Chakotay’s cell, which flickered to life with a curious glyph for just a moment before opening a comm channel to Voyager’s shuttlecraft. Chakotay could see Captain Janeway, Lieutenant Paris, Ensigns Kim, Vorik, and Kang, plus Chief Vance and Crewman Thorold crowded into the small craft.\n Chakotay’s heart dropped at the sight of Ensign Kang. What could have possessed Kathryn to bring her back here?\n Hux clapped his hands with delight. “Oh, excellent! Everyone’s here. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Hux. I’ll be your host here at the Delurididug Trade Hub.”\n Janeway glanced past the hologram, and her eyes locked on Chakotay. She looked back to Hux and said, “Hello, Mr. Hux. I’m Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager. May I speak to Commander Chakotay?”\n “Captain, I’m sorry, but time is short. I need your permission to transport your party directly onto the station.”\n “Send us the coordinates, and we’ll start beaming over when we’re ready.”\n Hux shook his head. “Sorry, but we have to follow some very specific guidelines here, and as I said, time is short. I need your permission to bypass standard docking protocols and transport your party immediately. Otherwise, I’ll have to confiscate our stolen property and send you back out of Trade Hub space, straight away.”\n Janeway’s expression went icy, and there was steel in her tone. “You won’t lay a finger on any member of my crew until we’ve had our hearing, Mr. Hux. I’ve familiarized myself with your legal guidelines, and–”\n “I’m really very sorry, Captain, but as I have told you more than once already, time is short! I must have your answer now: Will you permit me to beam your party aboard?”\n Janeway hesitated for just a moment before nodding.\n “Excellent. Everyone, please rise to your feet and collect any items you might need for the hearing. Is anyone staying behind on the shuttle?”\n “No,” said Janeway, and she looked to Paris, who nodded and began entering commands on his console. “The shuttle will mind itself for the time being.”\n “Very well,” said Hux. “I’ll bring you all aboard in fifteen seconds.”\n With that, the screen cut off. Hux turned back to Chakotay, beaming with excitement. “I think we’ve just narrowly avoided a disastrous outcome, Commander.”\n Chakotay wasn’t so sure.\n  \n \n  \n When the channel cut out, Lucy and the other members of the away team leaped to their feet and set about readying their equipment. Lucy had less to carry than the others; everyone else had shoulder bags with data nodules, tricorders, padds, samples of ship’s stores, and phaser rifles in place of standard-issue hand phasers. \n All Lucy had was her trusty tricorder and a standard-issue phaser. She double-checked the settings on her phaser, then unsheathed her tricorder and set about reviewing its calibration and configuration.\n Abruptly, the deck beneath her feet seemed to light up with an eerie, pure white glow. Lucy looked up and discovered she wasn’t on the shuttlecraft anymore. She found herself standing on a glowing, circular dais in a wide, domed chamber. Considering the light-up flooring, the featureless, alabaster walls, and the station’s holographic salesman staring her directly in the eye, Lucy assumed she’d been beamed onto the station.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[23, 32, "PER"], [40, 43, "PER"], [116, 126, "PER"], [236, 244, "PER"], [281, 295, "LOC"], [346, 354, "PER"], [491, 499, "PER"], [585, 588, "PER"], [791, 794, "PER"], [814, 822, "PER"], [886, 896, "PER"], [999, 1008, "SHIP"], [1023, 1031, "PER"], [1042, 1057, "PER"], [1059, 1075, "PER"], [1085, 1088, "PER"], [1090, 1095, "PER"], [1101, 1105, "PER"], [1112, 1124, "PER"], [1128, 1143, "PER"], [1175, 1185, "PER"], [1216, 1227, "PER"], [1255, 1262, "PER"], [1288, 1291, "PER"], [1397, 1400, "PER"], [1432, 1453, "LOC"], [1457, 1464, "PER"], [1515, 1523, "PER"], [1544, 1547, "PER"], [1566, 1573, "PER"], [1579, 1602, "PER"], [1619, 1626, "SHIP"], [1643, 1661, "PER"], [1666, 1673, "PER"], [1856, 1859, "PER"], [2150, 2165, "LOC"], [2184, 2193, "PER"], [2326, 2333, "PER"], [2419, 2426, "PER"], [2567, 2574, "PER"], [2775, 2782, "PER"], [2802, 2807, "PER"], [2934, 2937, "PER"], [3019, 3022, "PER"], [3038, 3046, "PER"], [3132, 3141, "PER"], [3145, 3153, "PER"], [3205, 3209, "PER"], [3310, 3314, "PER"], [3511, 3515, "PER"], [3798, 3802, "PER"], [4090, 4094, "PER"]]}
{"id": 29, "text": "“Hello, Ensign Kang,” said Hux. “I’m sorry we didn’t get a chance to meet on your last visit. How are those augmentations treating you?”\n “Hello, Hux,” said Lucy. She glanced around and noted the other members of the away team also standing on raised circular platforms of their own, and Chakotay was there with the rest of them, although his platform was surrounded with a shimmering forcefield. The platforms were strung like pearls on a choker around a shallow depression five meters wide.\n Hux stood at the center of the chamber, his feet a good half meter lower than the away team’s, and yet he towered over them, standing at least four meters tall. Lucy regarded the projection cooly, saying nothing more. After a moment, Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway.\n “Thank you for agreeing to come aboard under such unorthodox circumstances,” said Hux.\n “You didn’t give me much choice,” said Captain Janeway.\n “That’s true,” said Hux, tilting his head in consideration. “None of the alternatives you might have considered would have been wise, after all. Still, I’m grateful that we were able to find our way to a civilized forum in which to settle our conflict.”\n Janeway crossed her arms over her chest and looked the projection up and down, unimpressed with his immense stature and his casual arrogance.\n “Right.” Hux looked slightly disappointed at the captain’s frosty demeanor, but he just sighed and pushed ahead in a rote tone. “We’re here to adjudicate docket number eight-one-zero-six-six-nine-two, the limited commercial jurisdiction of the Delurididug Trade Hub, subsidiary of the Delurididug Trade Federation, versus Commander Chakotay of the USS Voyager, citizen of the planet Trebus and the United Federation of Planets, provisional officer of Starfleet, regarding alleged acts of industrial espionage, larceny, and use of Trade Hub services to circumvent native legal statutes. The defendant has the right to request an unaffiliated party from the Delurididug Trade Federation to serve as arbiter in this case.” \n Hux turned to address Chakotay directly. “The defendant has elected to waive this right in favor of an expedited hearing, is that correct?”\n Chakotay nodded. If they demanded a living Delurididug arbiter, they’d be waiting an eternity for one to arrive.\n “And how does the defense plea to the aforementioned charges?”\n “Not guilty,” said Captain Janeway.\n Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway.\n Janeway went on, “Let the record reflect that Captain Kathryn Janeway, Commander of the USS Voyager, citizen of Earth and the United Federation of Planets, officer of Starfleet, has chosen to represent her subordinate officer regarding all charges presented by the Trade Hub, per statute nineteen, sub-statute six of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.”\n Hux nodded. “Very well. The defense may now summarize their arguments in support of their plea on behalf of the defendant. Please be brief.”\n Janeway took a deep breath and began to speak. “The original away team, led by Chakotay, arrived at what appeared to be an abandoned space station after passing through a wormhole deep in the unexplored reaches of the Nekrit Expanse. The away team undertook a mission of peaceful exploration, not espionage or piracy, in accordance with my orders. \n “The away team entered the Trade Hub after receiving an automated invitation to dock. The away team received no further guidance or communication from the station after docking, and so they commenced to explore the space station on their own recognizance. They were seeking some means of expediting our trip back to our own civilization, which is situated on the far side of the galaxy. At no point were they provided with the station’s Terms of Service. This is in spite of statute one, sub-statute two, paragraph two of the Terms of Service, which states that the Trade Hub shall provide a complete copy of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service to all guests upon their arrival in Hub Space in a format and a language that the guests can readily interpret.\n “In spite of this lack of guidance, at no point did the away team lie or steal from the station. However, the station appeared to malfunction, inflicting its augmentation technology on my officer against her will. This officer, Ensign Lucille Kang, is the wronged party, not the Trade Hub. Ensign Kang is owed recompense for harm and suffering inflicted by the Trade Hub under statute five, sub-statute one-oh-three of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.”\n Hux absorbed Janeway’s statement with a neutral expression, and when he was certain she was finished, he went on, “At this time, the tribunal will receive all available evidence which is pertinent to this case. The tribunal presents as evidence the operational and security logs of the Trade Hub that were recorded at the time of the alleged misconduct, the subsequent statements of the defendant and the other witnesses, and the Aug-Tech subject Ensign Lucille Kang, which is able to act as a reliable record of the events by virtue of her illegally obtained Aug-Tech implants.\n “If the defense has evidence to submit, now is the time.”\n “The defense presents the complete case history of the Federation High Court,” said Janeway, “as well as the high courts of Alpha Centauri and the United Earth Government, the judgments of the Vulcan High Magistrate, and the precedents established by the Starfleet JAG division relating to genetic augmentation of Starfleet personnel, as requested by the tribunal. The defense also presents the duty and personal log entries made by all members of the away team and myself, from the hours preceding the events in question up until now.”\n Janeway opened the carrying case that hung from her shoulder and took out three isolinear data rods, which she held out for Hux’s inspection.\n “Additionally, the defense petitions the tribunal to abstain from intrusive contact with Ensign Kang under statute seven, sub-statute seventeen of the Trade Hub Terms of Service regarding the treatment of victims of violent crimes.”\n “As the tribunal has not established that Ensign Kang was, in fact, the victim of a crime, it must deny the defense’s petition,” said Hux.\n The data rods floated up, out of Janeway’s hand, momentarily startling the captain. The data rods drifted into the center of the circle, where Hux made a show of scooping them up with one insubstantial hand. Then Lucy felt a sudden weightlessness and found herself floating off of her platform, feet rising behind her until she tilted head-first, eye-level to Hux as she drifted forwards, into the center.\n Lucy looked around at the others, at Janeway’s alarm and Chakotay’s outrage, Harry’s shock, and Owen’s obviously violent intent. He was brandishing his phaser rifle with his right hand, his left tucked into his carrying case as if he were hunting for a second weapon. Crewman Thorold was following his lead, and Tom was watching them like he was considering following suit.\n “Stand down!” Captain Janeway shouted, and Thorold stopped what he was doing and stood at attention.\n Owen didn’t seem to hear her. He pulled what looked to be some kind of modified phase discriminator out of his case and popped open the side compartment of his phaser rifle.\n “Chief Vance, stand down!” Janeway bellowed.\n Owen hesitated. His gaze found Lucy’s, his eyes entreating, as if he were looking to her for a sign that he should ignore the captain’s order. Lucy shook her head.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[8, 19, "PER"], [27, 30, "PER"], [146, 149, "PER"], [157, 161, "PER"], [288, 296, "PER"], [494, 497, "PER"], [655, 659, "PER"], [728, 731, "PER"], [756, 771, "PER"], [856, 859, "PER"], [901, 916, "PER"], [939, 942, "PER"], [1174, 1181, "PER"], [1326, 1329, "PER"], [1366, 1375, "PER"], [1561, 1582, "ORG"], [1602, 1630, "ORG"], [1639, 1657, "PER"], [1665, 1676, "SHIP"], [1700, 1706, "LOC"], [1715, 1743, "GPE"], [1768, 1777, "ORG"], [1847, 1856, "ORG"], [1973, 2001, "ORG"], [2039, 2042, "PER"], [2061, 2069, "PER"], [2180, 2188, "PER"], [2223, 2234, "SPEC"], [2377, 2392, "PER"], [2395, 2398, "PER"], [2423, 2438, "PER"], [2441, 2448, "PER"], [2487, 2510, "PER"], [2512, 2521, "PER"], [2529, 2540, "SHIP"], [2553, 2558, "LOC"], [2567, 2595, "GPE"], [2608, 2617, "ORG"], [2706, 2715, "ORG"], [2762, 2783, "ORG"], [2804, 2807, "PER"], [2946, 2953, "PER"], [3025, 3033, "PER"], [3164, 3178, "LOC"], [3323, 3332, "LOC"], [3675, 3681, "LOC"], [3862, 3871, "ORG"], [3909, 3930, "ORG"], [3984, 3993, "LOC"], [4289, 4308, "PER"], [4340, 4349, "ORG"], [4351, 4362, "PER"], [4422, 4431, "ORG"], [4484, 4505, "ORG"], [4526, 4529, "PER"], [4539, 4548, "PER"], [4812, 4821, "ORG"], [4973, 4992, "PER"], [5220, 5241, "ORG"], [5249, 5256, "PER"], [5358, 5380, "ORG"], [5312, 5335, "ORG"], [5274, 5303, "ORG"], [5420, 5442, "ORG"], [5479, 5488, "ORG"], [5703, 5710, "PER"], [5827, 5832, "PER"], [5935, 5946, "PER"], [5997, 6006, "ORG"], [6122, 6133, "PER"], [6214, 6217, "PER"], [6253, 6262, "PER"], [6363, 6366, "PER"], [6433, 6437, "PER"], [6580, 6583, "PER"], [6627, 6631, "PER"], [6664, 6673, "PER"], [6684, 6694, "PER"], [6704, 6711, "PER"], [6723, 6729, "PER"], [6895, 6910, "PER"], [6939, 6942, "PER"], [7016, 7031, "PER"], [7045, 7052, "PER"], [7104, 7108, "PER"], [7280, 7291, "PER"], [7306, 7313, "PER"], [7325, 7329, "PER"], [7356, 7362, "PER"], [7451, 7460, "PER"], [7468, 7472, "PER"]]}

Then he shrugged. “Right. Where were we?” With that, Hux stretched out his free right hand for Lucy. Lucy raised her own left hand to meet his, and Hux touched his forefinger to hers.\n It didn’t feel like anything. Hux’s form was just empty, insubstantial light; no flesh, not even the simulated force-field flesh of a typical hologram. He didn’t touch her with his finger, but with a gentle tractor beam and a remote data uplink.
