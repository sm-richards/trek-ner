Sorry. But what if it is more than a mere\ndiscrepancy? \nLAFORGE: Then I'd say we have a problem. \nPICARD: Agreed. We'll have Starbase Montgomery give us an independent\nreading. \nDATA: Even if the molecular level controls have failed, we can still\nrecrystallise the dilithium without outside help. \nLAFORGE: Don't worry, Data. My ego isn't at stake here. \nDATA: Perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readout\nvariables \nPICARD: Well, that's certainly another option, but as we're stopping at\nStarbase Montgomery anyway, we'll let them do the analysis. \nRIKER: I don't recall Starbase Montgomery on the mission itinerary \nPICARD: I think we could all use a twelve hour layover.

I may have been somewhat miserly in my congratulations then,\nso let me make up for it now. The Captain of the Starship Ares is\nretiring. Congratulations. You've been selected as his replacement. \nRIKER: The Ares.
