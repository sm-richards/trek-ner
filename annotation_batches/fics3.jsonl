The biggest concern at the moment was the recent\n       Dominion/Cardassian alliance which threatened the alpha quadrant and\n       especially Bajor. Now that Bajor\u2019s deadliest enemies had joined forces, Kira\u2019s\n       home planet faced a very grim future indeed she thought as she sat at her post\n       in Ops.\n          Kira did not say a word to the other officers in Ops, rather she just began the\n       work of Deep Space Nine\u2019s commanding officer. Kira was in charge of the\n       station now that Captain Sisko was away overseeing repairs done on the\n       Defiant at Starbase 112. Neither Sisko nor his ship would be back for a week.\n       She missed them both.\n         The Defiant was one of the most powerful ships in the quadrant, and DS9\n       was always more vulnerable to attack when it was away, these days the\n       possibility of a Dominion attack seemed more and more likely. Kira also\n       wished that Sisko would return soon, because she hated the extra work. Fear of\n       Dominion attack, Dukat\u2019s recent betrayal, Odo confessing his love for her, all\n       this made Kira too depressed to run the station.\n          She was glad when Dax interrupted her and said \u201cKira, you should take a\n       look at this.\u201d\n       \u201cWhat is it Jadzia?\u201d Kira asked, as she too looked at Dax\u2019s monitor.\n       \u201cI am picking up a subspace echo,\u201d Dax replied \u201cIt could be anything from\n       natural stellar phenomena to a ship\u2019s warp signature.\u201d\n       \u201cWell at least it would give us something to do, let\u2019s check it out\u201d\n       \u201cI am getting more information now,\u201d Dax said \u201cit is definitely not natural.\n"}

It was an automated Federation distress call, and it was so weak\n       it was hard to make out. But what Kira did hear troubled her.\n       \u201cThis is the Federation starship Barkman, we have been attacked by Jem\u2019Hdar\n       fighters, our main power has failed.

That was\n       when he had first arrived on this station, now that he was older and had\n       realized how dangerous the universe can be he was not so enthusiastic. In fact ,\n       he almost wished he was not walking to the briefing room right now.\n          Bashir entered the room and saw that all the other senior officers except\n       Sisko and O\u2019Brien were present. They all had solemn expressions on their\n       faces, then again there was not much to smile about these days anyway. Kira\n       was at the head of the table, in Sisko\u2019s absence and Bashir took his seat.\n       \u201cGlad to see you could make it Doctor,\u201d Kira said \u201cFifteen minutes ago we\n       received a distress call from the USS Barkman, they were attacked Jem\u2019Hdar\n       fighters.\u201d\n       \u201cThe Barkman is a Miranda class starship with a crew compliment of fifty\n       three last assigned to map the Trinson nebula,\u201d said Worf.\n       \u201cBut that is nowhere near Cardassian space,\u201d Bashir offered.\n       \u201cWe know,\u201d Kira replied \u201cand if the Barkman was indeed attacked it could\n       signify a new Dominion offense.

Kes was sitting at her bedside watching the biomonitor.\n \u201cIt appears the ensign has undergone some rather extensive modifications,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cIn fact, it seems the modification process is ongoing. I have no way to stop it without doing potentially fatal harm to the patient.\u201d\n \u201cWhat kind of modifications? To what end?\u201d said Chakotay.\n The Doctor shook his head. \u201cTo what end, I can\u2019t say. It seems a number of biosynthetic implants have been embedded deep in her tissues.\u201d He turned to his desktop console and called up the results of his medical scans, superimposing the readings over a simple outline diagram of a human body. Lit up at multiple points on the diagram were silhouettes of slender little squid-like creatures, or machines\u2026 It was hard to classify the biosynthetic constructs one way or the other. They had heads like worms and many, many tendrils like threads that fanned out through her body. \n \u201cThey seem to be hardwired into her nervous system,\u201d the Doctor went on, \u201csending and receiving signals from her central nervous system. They\u2019re supplementing natural organ functions and regulating hormone levels, stimulating the growth of some cells and inhibiting others. They also seem to be modifying her DNA.\u201d\n Chakotay studied the diagram and the accompanying readings, a sense of disgust and trepidation rising up in him. \u201cThis resembles Borg technology. Is there any evidence of nanoprobes at work here?\u201d The desiccated corpse of a Borg drone he\u2019d stumbled upon on an away mission last week was still fresh in his mind. The specter of Borg cubes lurking just outside of sensor range in the murky depths of the Nekrid Expanse had haunted him ever since.\n \u201cCertainly not any of Borg design,\u201d said the Doctor, alleviating his fears but not quashing them completely. \u201cMy tests are ongoing, though.\u201d\n Chakotay studied the diagram closer. \u201cWhat do you make of this one?\u201d he said, pointing at the alien construct occupying the diagram\u2019s skull.\n \u201cThat implant is the one that worries me the most,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cIts processes are threaded throughout her brain. It might influence her cognition and her perceptions, bias her behavior\u2026 it could conceivably even be controlling her body. I\u2019ll monitor her engrams for any irregularities when she wakes.\u201d\n Chakotay was quiet for a moment, regarding his unconscious officer. He\u2019d let her down, back on that space station. He hadn\u2019t acted fast enough when that pod had opened. He should have destroyed the thing the moment it made a sound. He should have acted faster when the cables ensnared Ensign Kang. If only he\u2019d been faster, sharper, quicker on his feet\u2026\n He wouldn\u2019t let her down now. The alien space station still had her, even if she was out of the pod. He had to find a way to stop its progress before it finished turning her into\u2026 whatever it was turning her into.\n But, he couldn\u2019t let himself forget, he also had a duty to protect the rest of the crew. He tapped his combadge. \u201cChakotay to Tuvok,\u201d he said.\n \u201cTuvok here, sir.\u201d\n \u201cAssign two security personnel to sickbay. The Doctor will brief them when they arrive.\u201d\n \u201cAcknowledged,\u201d said Tuvok.\n Chakotay met the Doctor\u2019s gaze, and the Doctor nodded his understanding.\n \u201cUnder alien control or not, our crewmember is still in there, Doctor,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do everything in your power to help her.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, sir,\u201d said the Doctor.\n Chakotay walked out of the Doctor\u2019s office and crossed sickbay. The doors to the corridor opened as he approached, and standing outside was Chief Vance, looking very dour. That was fast, thought Chakotay. But then he noticed that the security officer wasn\u2019t approaching the door, but apparently dithering in the corridor. \u201cIs there something I can help you with, Chief?\u201d said Chakotay.\n Vance jumped to attention at the sight of his senior officer. \u201cNo, sir. I just wanted to know if I could visit the patient.\u201d\n Chakotay felt his eyebrow rising and quickly schooled his facial expression. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the Doctor,\u201d he said, and then he passed out into the corridor.\n  \n \u201c\u2026told her how you felt, before?\u201d It was a gentle, feminine voice. Lucy was sure she recognized it.\n \u201cYes\u2026 well\u2026 I mean, I think she has the general idea,\u201d said someone else. It was a man\u2019s voice, low and brash, and the connotations of his tenor stirred a sense of attraction, balanced on a knife\u2019s edge with a sense of discomfort.\n Owen, that was the second one. And the first one was Kes, Lucy remembered now.\n"}

Owen stood on her left, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Kes sat on her right, holding Lucy\u2019s hand. A couple other security officers stood guard by the sickbay doors. The Doctor was approaching from his office, his face a mask of concern.\n \u201cEnsign?\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n Lucy took stock of herself for a moment. The sickbay bed she was lying on was comfortable. The sickbay blanket felt nice on her skin. \u201cI feel alright,\u201d she said. She propped herself up on her elbows, and as her weight shifted, she noticed something about her body was\u2026 off. She couldn\u2019t immediately pin down what it was, though.\n The Doctor took a medical tricorder off a nearby shelf and began scanning her. Without lifting his eyes from the device, he tapped his badge and said, \u201cDoctor to the Bridge.\u201d\n \u201cJaneway here, Doctor,\u201d came the captain\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s your status?\u201d\n \u201cEnsign Kang is awake, sir.\u201d\n \u201cAcknowledged, Doctor. Thank you.\u201d\n The Doctor stopped scanning and looked back at his patient.\n \u201cAre you in any pain?\u201d he said.\n Lucy shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n The Doctor\u2019s concerned expression didn\u2019t waver. \u201cDo you know where you are right now, Ensign?\u201d\n Lucy chuckled a little at the question. \u201cSickbay. Voyager. The Delta Quadrant.\u201d\n The Doctor bit his lip for a moment and said, \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re in sickbay, Ensign Kang?\u201d\n \u201cWell\u2026\u201d said Lucy, and she glanced around at the others gathered around her bed. The intensity with which the Doctor, Kes and Owen were all looking at her was starting to make her a little bit uncomfortable. The security officers at the door to sickbay were troubling, as well.\n She returned her attention to the Doctor. \u201cI mean after what happened on the space station\u2026\u201d she cast a meaningful glance at Owen. It had been an intense ordeal, and Owen, at least, would know a bit about what she\u2019d been through. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a surprise.\u201d\n The Doctor nodded. He still looked worried. Lucy wondered why. She was fine, now. She felt fine. Did he know something she didn\u2019t?\n The Doctor turned to Owen. \u201cMr. Vance, I\u2019m sorry, but could you excuse us, please?\u201d\n Owen nodded. \u201cOf course, Doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright,\u201d he told Lucy.\n She saw the sincerity in his eyes, and it surprised her. She wondered if she hadn\u2019t been too hard on him before. It was obvious she was attracted to the security officer, so why did she have to make things complicated?\n Owen turned and headed towards the doors. Lucy called, \u201cHey Owen.\u201d He paused and looked back at her. Lucy smiled warmly at him. \u201cThanks for visiting me,\u201d she said.\n Owen\u2019s eyes grew a little wider. He flashed an uncertain smile and nodded, then left the sickbay.\n Lucy returned her attention to the Doctor, who was studying her face like a bug under a magnifying glass.\n \u201cEnsign, are you aware that your skin pigmentation is changing?\u201d he said.\n \u201cHuh?\u201d said Lucy. Her hand rose to her cheek. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m blushing?\u201d\n The Doctor shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d\n Lucy looked from the Doctor to Kes, who was squinting at Lucy\u2019s face now, too. \u201cYour lips are reddening,\u201d she said.\n \u201cReally?\u201d said Lucy. Her fingers moved to her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d\n Kes stood and crossed the sickbay, apparently looking for something. The Doctor sat down on the stool she\u2019d vacated.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cEnsign Kang, are you aware of any\u2026 out of the ordinary sensations? Any pain or discomfort, anywhere in your body?\u201d\n Lucy shifted her hips and rolled her shoulders, gauging her senses. \u201cNo, Doctor. I told you, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not experiencing any nausea? No trembling? No sense of weakness? No fear or anxiety?\u201d\n Lucy shook her head. \u201cNot really\u2026\u201d\n The Doctor sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s odd, considering what you\u2019ve just been through?\u201d\n Lucy shrugged. \u201cI mean\u2026 I\u2019m alive. That\u2019s what matters, right?\u201d\n The Doctor just shook his head. \u201cDo you have any sense of what was done to you on that station?\u201d\n Lucy considered. It was certainly not something pleasant to contemplate, but for the Doctor\u2019s sake, she tried.\n \u201cWell, at first, I was in a lot of pain, and I was terrified. I thought I was going to die, and what a horrible way it would have been to go.\u201d\n Lucy felt an involuntary shudder, but it seemed out of place to her. The recollection didn\u2019t actually bother her all that much.\n \u201cThen\u2026 all of a sudden, the pain stopped. I was literally being stabbed all over my body and twisted around by all these strong cords, and yet, somehow, it didn\u2019t hurt anymore. Maybe the pod used a numbing agent? And then, suddenly, I wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. I still thought I was dying. I guess maybe I was in shock? Or I\u2019d just accepted it as inevitable? But I wasn\u2019t scared at all, just\u2026 inexpressibly sad. I thought I\u2019d never get home again.\u201d\n It was hard to convey the experience to the Doctor. It was hard to even remember what it had felt like, to be that sad. She couldn\u2019t really find the feeling inside her anymore.\n \u201cThen, the sadness was gone too. That was the weirdest part. Like, I felt all these slimy tubes sticking into my body, and I could feel it under my skin. I could even feel it in my head. Like something out the worst, most disgusting, horrific nightmare. And all I could gin up in reaction was this big sense of, \u2018Wow, this should really be bothering me a lot more than it is.\u2019 But I guess I was just exhausted by that point. By the time the pod let me go, I was beyond ready to just pass out.\u201d\n Lucy\u2019s attention returned to her current surroundings. The Doctor looked at her with compassionate eyes. Kes stood in front of her bed, clutching a hand mirror against her chest. Her face was ashen, and tears were welling up in her wide eyes. She blinked several times to clear her eyes, and then she stepped forward and handed Lucy the mirror. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to see what we were talking about.\u201d The young Ocampan hardly got the words out before she turned away. She wiped her eyes with her hands as she walked quickly to the Doctor\u2019s office, letting the doors close behind her.\n Lucy didn\u2019t know what to make of that reaction. She supposed the story must have been pretty upsetting to hear.\n \u201cAre you upset, that that happened to you?\u201d said the Doctor.\n She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s over, now.\u201d\n \u201cAre you worried about what the lasting effects might be?\u201d\n Lucy shrugged. \u201cA little, maybe.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t in any pain.\u201d\n \u201cI told you, no. Why do you keep asking that?\u201d\n The Doctor took a deep breath. \u201cEnsign Kang\u2026 Lucy\u2026 currently, inside of your body, there are fifteen biosynthetic constructs of alien design, with countless threads branching out through all of your major organs. They\u2019re already fully integrated with your biology. I can\u2019t remove them. And they\u2019re\u2026 changing you.\u201d\n \u201cWow, that\u2019s\u2026 fascinating!\u201d said Lucy. \u201cAre they primarily organic, or do they incorporate organic tissues in an inorganic framework?\u201d\n The Doctor\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cI just told you your body was full of alien implants, Ensign. That isn\u2019t the sort of reaction I was expecting.\u201d\n Lucy reflected for a moment. \u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right. You said they\u2019re in every organ\u2026 that must include my brain. Do you suppose they\u2019re changing my behavior, too?\u201d\n The Doctor nodded. \u201cI think that\u2019s a safe deduction, yes,\u201d he said.\n \u201cThen, you must be worried that I could pose a threat to the ship,\u201d she said. She glanced at the security officers by the doors, Crewman Jeffery Thorold and Crewman Megan Steiner. Jeffery was watching her out of the corner of his eye. When he saw her looking at him, his attention returned directly ahead.\n \u201cKeep up the good work, Jeff, Megan,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cSorry I\u2019ve got you stuck on guard duty. I know it can be pretty dull.\u201d\n \u201cEnsign, would you please focus?\u201d said the Doctor.\n Lucy was surprised at his irritation, though she supposed she shouldn\u2019t have been. She understood the gravity of the situation, even if she was having some trouble feeling it.\n"}

{"text": "\n \n CHAPTER 5\n \u201cHere we go again,\u201d said Tom. He was seated on Chakotay\u2019s left, in the pilot seat of the shuttlecraft. Tuvok, Torres, and Kim filled out the rest of the party. \n Ahead of the shuttle, the violet eye of the wormhole loomed large. Chakotay found that the experience of having passed through the aperture twice already wasn\u2019t helping his stomach. His guts knew exactly what to expect, and it prepared for the ride by thrashing around inside of him well in advance.\n Chakotay cast a quick glance over his shoulder at the other three occupants of the shuttlecraft. Ensign Kim in the back looked about as green as Chakotay felt. Tuvok looked positively bored, as usual for the Vulcan. Torres was eyeing the wormhole with unwary fascination. She was obviously not prepared for the rough road that lay ahead.\n Chakotay caught her eye and flashed her an enigmatic smile that she clearly couldn\u2019t interpret, and then they passed into the wormhole.\n A slight shimmy rattled through the spaceframe of the shuttlecraft, and then they were out on the other side. That was it. No sudden jolt to the inertial dampeners, and no abrupt torque on the shuttle\u2019s nose cone, either.\n \u201cWhat, that was it?\u201d said Torres. \u201cI was expecting\u2026\u201d She shrugged.\n Chakotay gave Lieutenant Paris a questioning look.\n \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, sir,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI only wish I could take the credit.\u201d\n Ensign Kim consulted his console. \u201cVariances inside of the wormhole were down in the two millicochrane range,\u201d he said. \u201cTelemetry suggests the wormhole spontaneously stabilized in the last seconds before we made the passage.\u201d\n \u201cAnd now, the wormhole is returning to its previous degree of instability,\u201d Tuvok reported, consulting his own console. \u201cIt would appear that some external force acted momentarily to ensure our safe passage.\u201d\n As Chakotay considered that bit of information, Ensign Kim ran more scans of the space surrounding the abandoned station. Lieutenant Torres tore her attention from the stunning view outside with an effort and turned her attention to her own console.\n \u201cThe power output of the station is roughly twice what it was the last time we were here, Commander,\u201d said Ensign Kim.\n \u201cAt least,\u201d Torres added. \u201cAnd the power seems more stable and distributed around the station than what the telemetry from your last mission recorded.\u201d\n \u201cI guess the station\u2019s been doing some straightening up since our last visit,\u201d said Chakotay. He was just considering hailing the station again when his communications board lit up. \n A tone sounded from Ensign Kim\u2019s ops console, and he announced, \u201cCommander, we\u2019re being hailed.\u201d\n \u201cI see that, Ensign,\u201d said Chakotay, and he opened a channel with the press of a button.\n Lieutenant Paris said, \u201cCommander, are you sure that\u2019s such a good idea?\u201d but it was already done.\n Chakotay just regarded Tom with a cocked eyebrow and a slight shrug.\n \u201cWelcome, returning customers!\u201d The voice of the station resembled the voice from the last visit in inflection and tone only. Where before it had been grating and artificial, it now sounded as clear and natural as organic speech.\n It went on, \u201cYou\u2019ve reached the Delurididug Deep Space Travel Network and Trade Hub. Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Travel Network is currently unavailable. However, the Trade Hub is open for business! We are currently transmitting your instructions for docking.\u201d\n Chakotay\u2019s console received a packet of data from the station, which the computer was able to compile into a simple, graphically represented set of docking instructions. The voice from the station continued talking without pause.\n \u201cPlease be patient while those ships in queue ahead of yours finish their approaches and departures. Visitors will be cleared to dock in the same order that they arrived through the gateways.\u201d\n Chakotay glanced around the empty space around the station and exchanged a look with Lieutenant Paris. Tom shook his head. No one else was out there.\n The automated voice went on, \u201cAll forms of faster-than-light travel and remote matter transference are prohibited inside of Hub Space. Any unwarranted act of violence or aggression against the Hub, the Network, the proprietors of the Hub, or other visitors to the Hub or Network is also prohibited. All contracts joined in good faith within the confines of Hub Space are binding. The Hub and its licensed proprietors reserve the right to withhold service from any customer for any reason. The Hub and the Network are committed to upholding the laws of the Delurididug Trade Federation, as well as the laws specific to the nationalities of each customer, subject to the limits of Trade Federation Law. The Delurididug Trade Hub is empowered by the Delurididug Trade Federation to enforce all binding contracts within the limits of Trade Federation law. Violations of binding contracts are subject to summary arbitration, and may result in confiscation of trade goods or formally recognized legal tender, expulsion from Hub Space, arrest pending trial in a Trade Federation Tribunal, or any combination of the above, subject to the judgment of the administration of the Trade Hub and within the limits of Trade Federation Law.\n \u201cFor more on the rules, regulations, and policies governing the Trade Hub Station and its surrounding space, please refer to the terms of service that are being transmitted now.\u201d Chakotay studied his console as the computer received another data packet and compiled it into an encyclopedia-sized volume of alien legalese.\n \u201cTuvok, I\u2019m sending you their rulebook. See if there\u2019s anything in the rules about restricted areas. Maybe we can narrow down the possible locations of the computer core or their power generators, based on where they don\u2019t want us to go. And while you\u2019re at it, see if there\u2019s a procedure in place for filing complaints.\u201d\n \u201cAye, sir,\u201d said Tuvok.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cRespectfully, sir,\u201d said Paris, \u201cDo you really think there\u2019s someone over there that handles complaints?\u201d\n Chakotay shrugged. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the capabilities of the station, especially now that it\u2019s regained so much function. But it\u2019s clearly highly automated, and it seems to put a lot of value in laws and contracts. We might be able to use that to learn more about what\u2019s happening to Ensign Kang, and hopefully, how to reverse it.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not seriously counting on that station to respect Federation laws, are you?\u201d said Torres. \u201cOur Federation, that is.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not counting on anything, Lieutenant,\u201d said Chakotay, \u201cJust exploring all options.\u201d\n Harry shook his head, but he didn\u2019t look up from his console.\n \u201cSomething the matter, Ensign?\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Harry. \u201cJust\u2026 I keep thinking about Neelix\u2019s ghost story.\u201d\n Chakotay\u2019s reply was interrupted by the voice of the station. \u201cThank you for your patience. Your vessel has been cleared to dock. We are sending you an updated flight plan to guide you to your berth. Any deviation from the flight plan is grounds to revoke your boarding privileges and move your vessel to the back of the queue. Repeated or flagrant violations may lead to expulsion from Hub Space.\n \u201cIf you prefer, you may turn over guidance to the Trade Hub guidance system, and we will guide your vessel into its berth.\u201d\n \u201cFat chance,\u201d Tom remarked.\n Chakotay\u2019s console received the flight plan, and he sent it over to Tom. \u201cJust stick to the flight plan, Tom. I\u2019d hate to have to wait in that line again,\u201d he deadpanned.\n Tom gave Chakotay a quizzical glance, and Chakotay favored him with a slight smile. \n With a smirk, Tom turned his attention back to his console and punched a series of instructions into the shuttle\u2019s guidance system. \u201cAye, sir. Course laid in and plotted.\u201d\n \u201cTake us in,\u201d said Chakotay.\n  \n \n  \n They entered the station through the same port as on their previous visit. Inside the bay, conditions had changed markedly. The atmosphere and gravity were the same, but the illumination had increased significantly, owing to an array of free-floating orbs of yellow-white light that hovered over the shuttle bay like little Suns, giving the space an inviting, almost Earth-like quality.\n Tom set the shuttle down exactly where the flight plan indicated and ran quickly through his power-down checklist while the rest of the crew gave their reports on the station. When they were ready, Tuvok opened the shuttle door.\n And he froze in the doorway.\n His expression betrayed no surprise or confusion, so it took a moment for Chakotay to understand why the security chief had paused in place. Chakotay looked out through the door and found a man standing in the docking bay at the bottom of the shuttle\u2019s shallow ramp, hands spread wide in greeting.\n He looked human, with dusky but not dark features, slightly wavy, short, dark brown hair, the barest hint of points to his ears, the slightest upward angle of his eyebrows, and deep wrinkles in the center of his forehead that might have been the beginning of a cranial ridge. He had a wide smile, and his teeth were perfectly even and dazzlingly white. And, he wore a loose-fitting, flowing three-piece outfit woven from dark gray and deep burgundy fabrics, with curious accents of hardened leather on the shoulders and forearms, as if he were trying to split the difference between a traditional Terran suit, a Vulcan dignitary robe, and ceremonial Klingon armor.\n Tuvok overcame his momentary surprise and brought his tricorder to bear on the stranger.\n \u201cWelcome to the Delurididug Trade Hub,\u201d said the stranger. \u201cI\u2019m your host and point of contact for all of your questions and concerns regarding the station. You can call me Hux.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a projection, sir,\u201d said Tuvok.\n Hux\u2019s smile grew even wider. \u201cWell spotted, Lieutenant!\u201d he said. \u201cWhen your party is all prepared, I can lead you to any of the publicly available levels of the station.\u201d Turning to Chakotay, he said, \u201cTell me, how long can we expect to have the pleasure of your company, Commander\u2026\u201d\n \u201cChakotay,\u201d said Chakotay. He was quietly impressed that the projection was apparently able to read and interpret his provisional rank insignia. Clearly, the station had gathered quite a bit of information on its deep dive through the shuttle\u2019s computer core. He wondered if it didn\u2019t already know each of their names, and was only letting him introduce himself as a matter of politeness.\n Remembering the projection had asked him a question, Chakotay added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It will depend on\u2026 how we might be able to help each other.\u201d\n Hux nodded. \u201cI look forward to discussing that with you. For now, let\u2019s adjourn to a reception area, shall we?\u201d\n Chakotay glanced back at his away team and verified that they were all ready to proceed.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cLead the way,\u201d he said.\n Hux led the away team towards the doors at the edge of the docking bay. Chakotay was gratified to see that his officers instinctively arrayed themselves in a rough pentagon, tricorders out and scanning their surroundings, phasers holstered but charged. No one needed to be reminded that they were still boarding a dangerous and unpredictable relic of an ancient and powerful civilization, regardless of the warm welcome they\u2019d received thus far.\n When they reached the doorway, Hux stopped and addressed the party.\n \u201cNow, those of you who have visited the Hub in the past are no doubt familiar with the scanner up ahead. For the rest of you, there\u2019s no cause for alarm. The scanner is completely harmless. It provides the Trade Hub with a set of individualized biometrics in order to tailor our services for each individual. It\u2019s also a security feature. The scanner will catalog your sidearms and any other self-defense implements on your person, as well as any hazardous materials you might be carrying. \n \u201cNow, before you start to worry, allow me to reassure you that the Trade Hub does not make a habit of confiscating instruments of self-defense. However, we do employ a wide variety of neutralizing countermeasures in the event of accidental discharges or attempts at violence between guests. Your safety is among our highest priorities. If there are any questions about that, I\u2019d be happy to answer them.\u201d\n The others looked to Chakotay, and Hux seemed to follow their lead.\n Chakotay supposed it was a safe bet that the station was familiar with their phasers, seeing as it seemed to know everything else about them. He supposed there was no point in playing his cards close to his chest.\n \u201cMy away team is equipped with phased nadion beam weapons, calibrated to stun an attacker with non-lethal force. The Trade Hub won\u2019t interfere with their functioning?\u201d\n \u201cAh! Phasers are a classic, tried-and-true instrument of choice for a civilized society. And with a stun setting functionality! I applaud you on your choice. Humane, non-lethal weapons are truly a distinction of an advanced culture. \n \u201cOf course, the Trade Hub will not interfere with the operation of your weapons. However, if any of them should happen to discharge during your stay in the Trade Hub, our countermeasures will neutralize their effect. The only exception is in the highly unlikely event that a rogue actor somehow manages to circumvent station security and take aggressive actions against members of your party. In such a case, the Trade Hub will not interfere in your legally recognized right to defend yourselves. However, any collateral damage that you might incur in such an event will need to be settled before you depart.\u201d\n Chakotay nodded his understanding. \u201cWe\u2019re also carrying subspace transceivers and general purpose handheld scanners. These will also be allowed to operate without interference?\u201d\n \u201cOf course!\u201d said Hux, \u201cSo long as your instruments aren\u2019t used to violate Trade Hub regulations or terms of service, we will not interfere with their operation in any way. Now, are there any more questions?\u201d\n Chakotay glanced at the other members of the away team, inviting them to speak up if they could think of anything else to ask.\n \u201cNo?\u201d said Hux, \u201cExcellent. Let\u2019s proceed.\u201d\n The projection passed through the doorway. Chakotay waved Tuvok through, and the familiar light show flashed over him as he passed. Chakotay followed after, and the others followed him through, one at a time.\n When they were all through, Hux addressed the away team. \u201cNow then, where would you like to begin? I regret that the inoperable state of the Travel Network has left the Trade Hub with a shortage of licensed vendors, but the Trade Hub still provides innumerable automated services and unique goods of sale that I guarantee, you will not find anywhere else in the galaxy. Based on your consumer history, can I suggest we proceed to the Aug-Tech Parlor, first?\u201d\n Chakotay exchanged nonplussed expressions Tom and B\u2019elanna.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cAug-Tech? Why, it\u2019s our line of trademarked, consumer-grade, biosynthetic augmentation technologies, of course!\u201d\n \u201cIs that where we went on our previous visit?\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cWhy, yes. Are you interested in augmenting another member of your party? Or perhaps you\u2019re interested in purchasing one of our Aug-Tech augments for your crew? They\u2019re highly customizable, able to fill a vast array of functions with greater efficiency than you\u2019ve ever dreamed possible. Whether you\u2019re in need of soldiers, technicians, recreational specialists\u2026\u201d He finished with a wink, making it all-too-clear what kind of \u2018recreation\u2019 he was referring to.\n Chakotay tasted bile. With effort, he restrained his anger.\n \u201cNow, hold on!\u201d said Lieutenant Torres. The same outrage that Chakotay felt was clear on the half-Klingon engineer\u2019s face. Chakotay held up his hand to forestall an imminent outburst. Torres met his eyes and nodded her understanding.\n \u201cExplain these augments to me, please,\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cCould you specify?\u201d said Hux, \u201cWhat exactly would you like me to explain?\u201d\n \u201cAre your augments living, sentient beings? Do they have any rights at all, or are they just\u2026 slaves?\u201d\n Hux seemed confused by the question for just a moment before realization dawned. \u201cAh. I see your confusion,\u201d said Hux. \u201cIt seems such practices are illegal in your civilization.\u201d\n Chakotay nodded. \u201cYes, they certainly are.\u201d\n \u201cHm. Well then, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t sell you any augments after all. It is the policy of the Hub never to facilitate activities that are classified as unlawful in the civilizations of our guests, you see. I\u2019m terribly sorry if that poses any inconvenience.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if we wished to secure the freedom of your augments?\u201d said Chakotay.\n"}
{"text": "\n \n CHAPTER 6\n \u201cZut! That test was absolute merde!\u201d said Lucy. She was still enjoying her newfound grasp of twentieth-century French. She\u2019d studied Vulcan and Tellar languages in the Academy just to meet the core requirements, but she never really had a good head for languages. And besides, the universal translator was simply too convenient of a shortcut to even bother. She would have been hard pressed, these days, to recall even the more salient Tellarite curse words. But now, French invectives were free-flowing.\n \u201cWhoever wrote that program can br\u00fble en l\u2019enfer! And what are you laughing at, Owen?\u201d\n She whirled about on the security officer who was escorting her back to sickbay.\n Owen pinched his lips tight, trying to hide his mirth and failing. The other security officer, Crewman DeVries, subtly distanced himself from Owen, leaving him to bear the brunt of Lucy\u2019s wrath.\n \u201cIs it funny to you, that the Doctor is going to judge my fitness as a Starfleet officer on the outcome of a badly written holodeck melodrama?\u201d\n After a promising start, the atmospheric Roma carnival setting had dissolved into chaos. A series of contrived plot twists revealed that half the food vendors were actually terrorists. They locked down the fairgrounds and rounded up as many hostages as they could get their hands on. Of course, the task of rescuing everyone fell almost immediately on Lucy. There was never a satisfactory reason given for this. She was simply a stranger in their midst that everyone decided to turn to for leadership. \n By this point, Lucy strongly suspected that someone had taken a beautifully crafted holodeck worldspace and overwritten it with the plot of a haphazard, clich\u00e9d action/adventure novel.\n Owen shook his head. \u201cNo. You\u2019re right. The Doctor\u2019s program was\u2026 merde.\u201d He struggled and failed to hold in a smile.\n \u201cThen what\u2019s so funny?\u201d Lucy shouted.\n \u201cNothing,\u201d said Owen. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 nice to see you getting angry.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Lucy. She shook her head in bewilderment. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cJust\u2026\u201d Owen cast a glance at Bobby DeVries, and lowered his voice to near-inaudibility. \u201cSince what happened\u2026 You haven\u2019t once gotten upset about anything.\u201d\n Lucy blinked. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n \u201cSo it was a really upsetting thing that happened!\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in denial about it or what, but\u2026\u201d\n DeVries cleared his throat, bringing Owen up short.\n \u201cSorry,\u201d said Owen, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk about that. Let\u2019s just get back to sickbay, ok?\u201d\n Lucy didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not in denial,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what was done to me. I feel it, even now. But the worst is long over. I understand why everyone has their doubts, but I wish people would listen to me when I say I\u2019m fine!\u201d\n Owen sighed. \u201cWell, good. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok. But I can\u2019t help worrying about you, Lucy.\u201d\n She almost asked \u201cWhy,\u201d but the look on his face drew her up short. His concerns were etched into the lines around his ice-blue eyes, and deeper emotions seemed to dwell just under the surface of his gaze.\n Suddenly, Lucy didn\u2019t know what to say. She stared into his eyes for a long moment, looking for a clearer sign of what he was thinking.\n Bobby cleared his throat again.\n Owen cast an annoyed glance at his colleague, then looked back at Lucy. \u201cYour eyes are changing again,\u201d he said.\n \u201cOh?\u201d said Lucy. \u201cNow what are they doing?\u201d\n Owen smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re going back to normal. They\u2019re dark brown again, and the makeup is fading, too.\u201d\n Lucy was relieved to hear it. She glanced down at her arms and saw her porcelain pallor was returning to its natural, olive tones. \u201cGood,\u201d she said.\n Another beat of silence passed, and suddenly it felt awkward.\n \u201cWell, the Doctor\u2019s going to start wondering where we are,\u201d said Owen.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cRight,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She turned around to head towards sickbay, but at the mention of the Doctor, she remembered the bloodbath that the holonovel had become, and her anger returned in force. \u201cBut I swear, if he tries to blame me for the outcome of that terrible program\u2026\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll vouch for you,\u201d said Owen. He put a comforting hand on her shoulder, and soothing warmth seemed to suffuse her body from the touch, working wonders for her temper. She was halfway tempted to put her hand over his until he began gently pushing, trying to urge her back into motion. \u201cYou did everything that could be expected from a junior science officer.\u201d\n The way he qualified his statement rubbed Lucy the wrong way. She pushed his hand away and turned on him again. \u201cWhat, you think you could have done better?\u201d she challenged.\n Owen just pointed down the corridor towards sickbay.\n \u201cHmpf,\u201d said Lucy, and she turned around and marched the rest of the way to sickbay without looking back.\n  \n \n  \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ensign, I can\u2019t clear you for duty yet.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d said Lucy, \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t save some of the hostages?\u201d\n \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d said the Doctor.\n They were back in the Doctor\u2019s office, and Owen and Bobby were back to guarding the entrance to sickbay. For now, Lucy and the Doctor could converse in private.\n \u201cWhat was I supposed to do,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cgo all Michael Bernam? Maybe that would have worked in that two-bit hack holonovel, but in the real world\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI said\u2026\u201d the Doctor tried to talk over her, but Lucy steamrolled forward.\n \u201cThose sorts of shoot-from-the-hip heroics just start wars and get people killed! I tried to get into their heads. I tried to find their motivations so I could work out a peaceful resolution! Little did I know, they were all just cartoon villains! If you took me to the holodeck just to play a shoot-em-up, why even\u2014\u201d\n \u201cEnsign Kang!\u201d the Doctor shouted, and finally, Lucy broke off her tirade. \u201cYour performance in that\u2026 \u2018two-bit hack holonovel\u2019 that I wrote\u2026\u201d \n Lucy cringed. \n \u201c\u2026is not the issue. The goal was never to judge you by the outcome of the scenario, but to assess your mental condition by your behavior under unfamiliar and stressful circumstances.\u201d\n Lucy absorbed this fact and struggled to process it. \u201cIs this because I bought a hat, then?\u201d\n The Doctor sighed. \u201cNo. It was not any single decision or mistake that you made.\u201d\n \u201cThen please, Doctor,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cexplain it to me. I really can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n The Doctor paused to consider. \u201cAnd how does that make you feel?\u201d\n \u201cUpset,\u201d said Lucy.\n \u201cUpset how?\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cDoes it make you sad? Or are you afraid for your career? Your future?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cI\u2019m angry, and I\u2019m frustrated. I had a goal. I was supposed to save those hostages, but it was a total Kobayashi Maru. The only way to break the stalemate would have been to start killing terrorists.\u201d\n \u201cAnd did that ever cross your mind as a legitimate option?\u201d said the Doctor.\n \u201cNot for a moment,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cEven if we could have killed them all with zero collateral damage, which I highly doubt, and in spite of the fact I didn\u2019t agree with their methods or their goals, it wasn\u2019t my place to pick sides in their conflict. It was a classic Prime Directive scenario.\u201d\n The Doctor paused, momentarily considering her point. \u201cAn interesting perspective.\u201d\n \u201cIs that why I failed?\u201d\n The Doctor uttered a frustrated sigh. \u201cI told you, it was nothing specific! There was no \u2018right\u2019 answer! Ensign\u2026\u201d He grasped for the right words for a moment before going on, \u201cYou can\u2019t feel pain. Your shoe melted into your foot, and you didn\u2019t even limp. And your emotional responses are completely atypical. You showed more concern for the shoe than for your foot, and you demonstrated as much sympathy for the terrorists as for the victims.\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\u201cI was mediating!\u201d Lucy retorted, but the Doctor went on regardless.\n \u201cYou approached them without even trying to work out out a contingency plan or find a weapon for self-defense. They could have shot you where you stood just to make a point!\u201d\n \u201cThey were scared!\u201d said Lucy. \u201cThey needed someone to hear their demands, or they would have started killing hostages even sooner. Your writing made it obvious that I was the one that would be expected to step forward, so I did. I was just following the plot.\u201d\n \u201cAs you saw it, perhaps,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cBut the most serious problem had nothing to do with your choices or your emotions. Ensign, your biosynthetic implants just dropped the entire French language into your head, and you didn\u2019t skip a beat. You hardly even noticed, until I pointed it out. That degree of cognitive synergy speaks to the profound extent to which an unknown alien artificial intelligence has insinuated itself into your brain.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Lucy. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m Lucy Kang anymore? What am I then, a Borg?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re still you,\u201d said the Doctor, his voice much softer than before. \u201cYou\u2019re still Lucille Kang. Your capacity for empathy, your cleverness, your wit, that\u2019s all you. But you\u2019re something more, now, too. That\u2019s what frightens me.\u201d\n \u201cWell then, how long is it going to take, to prove I can be trusted again?\u201d said Lucy.\n The Doctor shook his head. \u201cHopefully, we won\u2019t have to deal with that. Commander Chakotay is back on that station right now, looking for a way to reverse what was done to you.\u201d\n Lucy tasted something bitter. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d she said.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right, I should have,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cI was preoccupied with setting up your assessment.\u201d\n Lucy shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only person who could have let me know. The Captain, or Chakotay, or anyone on the senior staff could have told me what they intended to do. I\u2019m just an afterthought in all this, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n \u201cFar from it, Ensign,\u201d said the Doctor.\n \u201cBut what if the cure is just as grisly and invasive as the cause? Will they even ask my permission, or will they just order me to hop back into that pod?\u201d\n \u201cEnsign\u2026\u201d\n Lucy shook her head. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even give me a chance, did they? They saw I looked different, they saw I acted different, and immediately they just assumed they had to \u2018turn me back\u2019 somehow. I can\u2019t even imagine what that would be like, Doctor! All this trauma and misery that people keep expecting me to feel? Why would I want that?\u201d\n The Doctor looked perplexed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be\u2026 you again, Lucy?\u201d\n \u201cI am me, Doctor! You said it yourself! I\u2019m me, and I\u2019m more! And your bogus test is a far cry from convincing me that that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d\n The Doctor\u2019s confusion faded, giving rise to a carefully neutral expression. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to pass that sentiment on to the Captain, then,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWell\u2026 good!\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI\u2019m a member of this crew, dammit. I deserve to be heard.\u201d\n The Doctor nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n With that settled, Lucy walked out of the Doctor\u2019s office and back into sickbay. \u201cSo, what am I supposed to do now? Sit on a biobed and twiddle my thumbs?\u201d\n The Doctor shook his head. \u201cYour security clearances are still on hold, but you\u2019re clear to visit all unrestricted areas of the ship. You\u2019ll have two security personnel with you at all times outside of your quarters, and your activities will be monitored.\u201d\n Lucy opened her mouth to complain, but the Doctor cut her off. \n \u201cThose are the captain\u2019s orders. Furthermore, you\u2019re to report back to sickbay at oh-seven-hundred hours for a complete medical assessment, so I can monitor the progression of your condition. And keep me informed of any new symptoms you may experience in the meantime. Those are my orders. Are we clear, Ensign?\u201d\n \u201cYes, Doctor,\u201d said Lucy, making every effort to stifle her resentment. As stacked as the test had seemed, she had to acknowledge that the Doctor knew what he was doing. Whether she agreed with him or not, his judgment must have had some merit, at least from a certain point of view. Continuing to belabor the point would only serve to reinforce his conclusions.\n Lucy turned to the sickbay doors and walked straight through, studiously avoiding eye contact with Owen or Bobby as she passed between them. Without looking back, she knew they had followed her through the door by their soft footsteps on the carpeted deck.\n Lucy pondered what to do with the rest of her day. She couldn\u2019t even enter the BNG labs without her security clearances. She found it a little absurd that she would even contemplate visiting her workplace on a day off, and yet, she yearned to do just that. Voyager only had a couple other technicians that were even qualified to do her job, and they would both be pulling extra shifts for the foreseeable future to cover for her absence. Even if she couldn\u2019t take on any of the work, she would have liked to check in on them and offer some moral support. Maybe she could catch up with Raeger or Kigon in the commissary later to see if they could use any work advice or moral support, but right now they were sure to be in the middle of a shift or deep in a sleep cycle.\n She wasn\u2019t hungry, so there was no reason to visit the commissary right now. She was absolutely sick of holograms, so obviously the Holodeck was out of the question. Lucy supposed she might as well just return to her quarters.\n Crewman Jarvin passed Lucy in the corridor. His step faltered when he saw her, and his eyes darted over her several times.\n \u201cSomething the matter, Crewman?\u201d said Lucy.\n"}
{"text": "\n \n CHAPTER 7\n \u201cI say we fly Voyager in there and ram a few photon torpedoes up their aft ventral porthole! See how they like that!\u201d Lieutenant Torres raged. \n The senior staff was gathered in the conference room, minus Chakotay, who was still being held captive on the space station. They hadn\u2019t been sitting at the conference table more than a couple minutes before Torres was back on her feet, though, pacing back and forth down the length of the table.\n Janeway regarded the hot-headed engineer patiently, deciding it would be better just to let Torres vent her frustrations and get it out of the way. After all, she was just giving voice to the frustration that pervaded the whole room. They were angry, and they were worried for Chakotay, and everyone needed to acknowledge it\u2014everyone but Tuvok, of course.\n  \u201cThe Delurididug Trade Hub holds significant strategic advantages over Voyager,\u201d he Vulcan-splained. \u201cIt exists within an isolated region of space, over which it appears to control both ingress and egress. It has far more advanced technology than Voyager, it generates far more power than Voyager, and its immense bulk likely hides defensive systems significantly more formidable than Voyager\u2019s. Such a confrontation is unlikely to end in our favor.\u201d\n Torres waved off his objection. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if the station is armed. We scanned every inch of it, and I didn\u2019t see an operational weapons system.\u201d\n \u201cIndeed,\u201d said Tuvok, \u201cWe have been able to discern very little about key functions on the station. We cannot identify a computer core, a power source, or any form of warp field generator. And yet, we have ample evidence that the station has each of these systems. Therefore, the station is either employing technology so foreign and advanced that we cannot recognize it, or it is somehow disguising these systems from our scans. The same could go for weapons.\u201d\n B\u2019elanna shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s unmanned. Whatever advanced technology may or may not be on board is useless if no one is there to operate it.\u201d\n Tuvok arched an eyebrow. \u201cIs it your contention that the A.I. of the station is incapable of autonomous self-defense?\u201d\n B\u2019elanna looked uncertain for a moment. Then she threw her hands up and plopped herself back into her chair. \u201cOh, how the hell should I know?\u201d she said.\n Tuvok nodded. \u201cWell put, Lieutenant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not know enough at this time to justify putting Voyager at risk.\u201d\n \u201cSo what, then?\u201d said Torres, \u201cDo we abandon Commander Chakotay? Or do we play along? Throw ourselves on the mercy of a long-defunct court and the judgment of a malfunctioning hologram?\u201d\n \u201cWhether or not we take that course should depend on the laws of the court in question. I am still in the process of familiarizing myself with the Delurididug legal code. It is a curious system of governance; a technocratic meritocracy, its laws rigid, yet robust; idiosyncratic, yet imminently logical. Once we have an adequate understanding of their laws, we may be able to formulate an effective defense for Commander Chakotay.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what if we can\u2019t?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t have a case? Then what do we do?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe we can plan a jailbreak,\u201d said Tom.\n \u201cI would calculate our odds of securing Commander Chakotay\u2019s escape as less than one point five percent, given their ability to neutralize our weapons inside of the station,\u201d said Tuvok.\n \u201cAnd even if we manage to pull it off, we can forget about getting a wormhole to the Federation,\u201d said Harry, \u201cOr curing Ensign Kang.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid there are other hurdles where Ensign Kang is concerned,\u201d said the Doctor.\n The others turned to the wall monitor that displayed the Doctor\u2019s image.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the status of your patient, Doctor?\u201d said Captain Janeway.\n The Doctor took a moment to consider his response. \u201cWell, physically, her condition is downright superhuman. I\u2019ve been monitoring her vitals and activities remotely since she left sickbay. She spent an hour in the deck eight gymnasium, during which time she performed a complete calisthenics routine at three times standard gravity, ran twenty-five kilometers, and burned over four thousand calories. Her pulse never exceeded one hundred twenty beats a minute, and as far as I can tell from remote sensors, there was none of the lactic acid buildup in her tissues that such a strenuous workout should have produced. Afterward, she ordered an eighteen hundred calorie meal from her personal replicator, and at last check, she appeared to be sleeping. I\u2019ll be able to tell you more about her physical condition in the morning, after her next physical.\n \u201cPsychologically\u2026 The results of my assessment were deeply ambiguous. Her problem-solving abilities are excellent, but prior testing suggests this is a pre-existing trait. Her regard for life and her empathic instincts are very strong, but by the same token, her capacity for emotional detachment is lacking. Again, this matches the results of her prior psychological assessments. In these regards, her personality is essentially intact.\n \u201cOne item of concern is her lack of cautious reflexes. If she saw a snake by her foot, for instance, she would not jump away from it on instinct. She would register the snake, decide consciously if it were a threat, and reason out an appropriate reaction. By the time she decided what to do, the snake might have already bitten her ankle. Her power of reasoning is excellent, but in emotionally fraught and emergent situations, I\u2019m afraid this cognitive deficit will present a powerful liability.\n \u201cOf even greater concern are the cognitive enhancements that she has begun demonstrating. During the assessment, I chose to deprive the ensign of her universal translator. Seeing as many of the characters in the program spoke only 20th Century French, I thought this would provide an additional challenge. Instead, the ensign learned a new language, fluently, in a matter of minutes\u2014just by being in the presence of people speaking it. The implants are certainly interacting with her brain, providing cognitive enhancements in specialized tasks like language acquisition. As to any other ways they may be affecting her cognition, I can\u2019t yet say.\n \u201cBut what concerns me most of all is that the ensign is starting to show a strong reticence towards the notion of reversing her condition.\u201d\n There was a beat of quiet around the conference table as the staff absorbed the Doctor\u2019s meaning. Evidently, none of the others had considered that Ensign Kang might not want to be cured.\n \u201cWell, I guess I can\u2019t really blame her,\u201d said Tom.\n The others all looked at Tom, and he sat forward in his chair.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cHey, she\u2019s got superpowers,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\u201d\n Tuvok\u2019s eyebrow crawled about halfway up his scalp.\n \u201cFiguratively, I mean,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd she\u2019s unrestrained by negative emotions. That sounds like it would be hard to give up.\u201d\n \u201cActually,\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cShe has quite a few negative emotions. Unfortunately, without the ability to express sorrow about her circumstances, her emotional release seems to come primarily in the form of anger. She\u2019s resentful, Captain. She feels she should have been consulted before Commander Chakotay led a risky away mission on her behalf. She resents being treated with suspicion and kept from resuming her post. So far, her reason and her sense of empathy seem to be working to defuse her anger, but I\u2019m not convinced it will last.\u201d\n Janeway nodded to the Doctor. \u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, I think she has a point,\u201d she said. Then she addressed the room. \n \u201cTorres, Kim, get to work analyzing all the data we have on the structure of the station. We need to learn as much as we can about its external hardpoints and its internal structure. Paris, get with Lieutenant Ayala and start on that jailbreak scenario. \n \u201cTuvok, I\u2019ll need you sorting out their laws and devising our case. Gather all the help you need, from any department. \n \u201cIf we can beat their legal system, we will. If we can\u2019t, we go with a jailbreak. And in case that fails, Torres, Kim\u2026 once we know everything we possibly can about that station, start working on a way to cripple it. Once we have the upper hand, maybe the station will listen to reason. But that\u2019s our last resort.\n \u201cDoes anyone have questions?\u201d\n \u201cWhat about Ensign Kang, sir?\u201d said the Doctor.\n Janeway rested her chin on her hand a moment, her gaze far away, as she considered the problem. \u201cThat is the question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Finally, she braced her hands against the table and pushed herself up to her feet. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I paid her a visit. Now, let\u2019s get to work, people. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\n  \n \n  \n Lucy writhed languidly against the silky fabric of her bedsheets, reveling in the afterglow. Owen rested his head on his hands and stared up at the deckhead, an easy, almost sedated smile on his face. She rolled over to face him, propping herself up on her elbow.\n He cast a sidelong glance her way, and she quirked a questioning eyebrow. He reached out and ran his hand through her hair just above her left ear, gently massaging her scalp with his fingertips.\n \u201cAre you petting me like a dog right now?\u201d said Lucy, although she made no move to stop him. His touch sent happy shivers through her whole body.\n \u201cJust making sure you\u2019re not secretly a Deltan,\u201d said Owen.\n Lucy gave a breathy chuckle. \u201cWhy, because you\u2019re afraid my lovemaking has left you incurably insane? Or is it because my hair looks like a wig?\u201d Deltans had a near-human aspect, minus cranial hair. They were also legendary love-makers, with passions so intense they could literally drive a human mad. Or that was the legend, at any rate. Lucy doubted it could be entirely accurate.\n \u201cDefinitely the first one,\u201d he said.\n Lucy nearly made a pithy retort about how with her enhancements, anything was possible, but she held back\u2014in part, because she was sick of bringing up the subject, and in part, because she realized it was true.\n \u201cDo you think this might have been a mistake?\u201d she said.\n Owen\u2019s expression sobered. His hand slid from her hair to her cheek, cupping her jawline with his palm. He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n Lucy sighed. She couldn\u2019t help nuzzling into his hand a little bit, but she couldn\u2019t ignore the implications of what they\u2019d just done. She leaned back, breaking contact.\n \u201cWhat if I\u2019m contagious, somehow?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cThe Doctor wouldn\u2019t have let you out of sickbay,\u201d he said.\n Lucy shrugged. \u201cWhat does he know? I\u2019m infected with technology centuries ahead of ours. The Doctor can only guess what all it can do.\u201d\n Owen considered for a moment. \u201cWell then, at least you won\u2019t be going through it alone anymore.\u201d\n Lucy rolled her eyes. \u201cCome on, that wouldn\u2019t make me feel any better. I\u2019d just feel guilty for dragging you down with me.\u201d\n \u201cDragging me up, you mean? Your thing comes with enhancements, remember?\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\u201cWhatever, you know what I mean.\u201d\n \u201cWell, either way, you\u2019d have no reason to feel guilty. I seduced you, remember?\u201d\n Lucy laughed. \u201cIs that what you call insulting me, and then begging for forgiveness?\u201d\n Owen put on a roguish smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my trademark Vance charm.\u201d\n He was so cute when he showed unearned confidence. Lucy leaned closer to him.\n \u201cOh, that\u2019s what it is?\u201d said Lucy. She brought her face within a couple centimeters of his. She could feel his breath on her cheek.\n \u201cUh huh,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYeah?\u201d she said, and she kissed him. He returned her kiss readily, and things progressed quickly from there. Soon, the world seemed to fade away around them, until nothing was left but those points where their two bodies met; hands exploring sensitive flesh, legs brushing legs, interlocking lips, conjoined hips, and nothing in between them but friction and perspiration.\n Afterward, Lucy and Owen both stared up at the deckhead. Lucy felt as blissful and sensuous as ever, but Owen was starting to doze off, his eyelids slowly drifting shut.\n Then, that same nagging doubt popped back into her mind. \u201cDo you think the Doctor will be mad?\u201d she said.\n Owen opened his eyes again and looked at her. \u201cAre you going to tell him?\u201d\n \u201cI have another check-up first thing in the morning,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n Owen\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWell, he never told you not to have sex, did he?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cBut now it seems like kind of a no-brainer, right?\u201d\n Owen shrugged. \u201cWell, what\u2019s done is done. I\u2019ll report to sickbay with you and get checked over, just to be safe, ok?\u201d\n Lucy tried to imagine the Doctor\u2019s reaction when they confessed what they\u2019d done. She smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll definitely be mad. You sure you want to be there when he finds out?\u201d\n \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want you to bear the brunt of it.\u201d\n Lucy shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of that.\u201d\n \u201cOf course not,\u201d said Owen. \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of anything.\u201d\n There was a quiet beat. Lucy realized she was getting pretty hungry. \n \u201cYou wanna get some\u2014\u201d \n \u201cSorry.\u201d\n They\u2019d spoken at the same time.\n \u201cFor what?\u201d said Lucy. \n \u201cI mean\u2026\u201d said Owen, and he studied her face for a second. Lucy stared back, mildly confused. What had he done this time?\n \u201cNothing,\u201d said Owen. \u201cNevermind.\u201d\n Lucy nodded, deciding that if Owen had stuck his foot in his mouth again and she\u2019d missed it, then it was really for the best.\n \u201cYou wanna get some kimbap?\u201d said Lucy.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Owen.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like sushi,\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\n \n CHAPTER 8\n Chakotay sampled a dab of protein paste and grimaced. It resembled old, plain oatmeal, congealed and devoid of flavor. Chakotay took a moment to gird himself, then he picked up the tube of paste and squeezed its contents directly into his mouth.\n \u201cUgh, ack.\u201d He grabbed the water bladder he\u2019d been provided with his meal and bit down on the valve to let the liquid free, washing down the slimy paste with three deep gulps of lukewarm water.\n \u201cI know, putrid stuff,\u201d said Hux. \u201cNot that I have any direct experience, mind you, but I\u2019ve fed similar concoctions to twelve thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two other detained visitors over the millennia, and all but one hundred and fourteen of them provided unfavorable reviews.\u201d\n Chakotay took one more pull on the water bladder and swished it around his mouth, clearing the last bits of paste from his palate before swallowing.\n \u201cOne and a half stars,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse, but not by much.\u201d\n Hux nodded thoughtfully, no doubt adding another negative review to his tally.\n \u201cWell, it\u2019ll keep you nourished, at any rate. The Delurididug Trade Federation does not neglect its detainees.\u201d\n Chakotay was forced to agree. The room in which the station held him captive resembled a budget suite at a Rigelian hostel more than a holding cell. The cot in the corner was clean and reasonably comfortable, there were a table and three chairs, there was a food slot on the wall where the protein paste had materialized, and there was an interface screen on the wall, although it was off, and it had no obvious controls. A single floating orb of yellow-white light hovered near the ceiling, providing comfortable illumination for the room.\n Chakotay contemplated the depleted tube of protein paste on the table in front of him, wishing there was something else he could eat. The modest serving of paste would probably sustain him in his captivity until his shipmates returned, but it was far from filling.\n Hux took a seat opposite Chakotay at the table and leaned in, resting his illusory weight on his holographic elbows. \u201cWould you like to try something you might find a bit more palatable?\u201d said the projection.\n Chakotay arched an eyebrow. No doubt, it would come at a cost. It occurred to Chakotay that he still didn\u2019t know what the Trade Hub actually traded for.\n \u201cUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t got any currency,\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not such a problem,\u201d said Hux. \u201cThe Trade Hub receives many visitors who have no formal trade relations or currency exchanges with the Delurididug Trade Federation. We are more than happy to barter.\u201d\n Chakotay sighed and sat back in his chair. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have anything to barter, either. However, Voyager has stores of dilithium crystal, gold-pressed latinum, verterium cortenide\u2026\u201d\n Hux shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but from what I can gather of your people\u2019s technological development, I doubt you possess any kind of mineral wealth that we can\u2019t synthesize for ourselves on the station.\u201d\n That brought Chakotay up short. \u201cWell\u2026 Why don\u2019t you try me? What would you be interested in?\u201d\n Hux looked dubious. \u201cCrystalline benamite? Bioavailable kironide? Anti-protomatter? Polyphasic neutronium? Hexaburnium?\u201d\n Chakotay shook his head, suddenly feeling a lot less confident that they would be able to win over the station\u2019s cooperation through trade. He\u2019d never even heard of a few of the things Hux listed. Still, he pushed forward. \u201cWe might be able to track down some of those things on the other side of the wormhole if you make it worth our while,\u201d he said.\n Hux shook his head. \u201cBy the time you returned, your access point would be long gone.\u201d\n The hairs on Chakotay\u2019s neck rose, and he sat up in his chair. He reined himself in, though, not wanting his captor to catch him fretting. Affecting an air of nonchalance, he adjusted the sleeve of his uniform and said, \u201cThe wormhole isn\u2019t a permanent structure? How much longer will it last?\u201d\n Hux put his hands up in a placating gesture, as if Chakotay had exploded in panic. \u201cIt should last long enough for us to conclude our business, so long as your shipmates don\u2019t dawdle. Maintaining the access point over the long term simply isn\u2019t cost effective during the current Travel Network maintenance cycle, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n Chakotay considered the hologram\u2019s words for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m curious, how long has the current maintenance cycle been in progress?\u201d\n \u201cFour thousand, one hundred and forty-one Earth years,\u201d said Hux.\n \u201cThat can\u2019t be right,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cWhat kind of maintenance cycle is measured in millennia?\u201d\n Hux shrugged. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience. Occasional, unforeseen delays are inevitable in eight-dimensional, sub-spatial architecture projects of this magnitude.\u201d\n \u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s a way for Voyager to help you hasten your repairs.\u201d\n Hux shook his head sadly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s out of the question.\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\u201cWhy?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon have this current misunderstanding out of the way. I hope that when that\u2019s taken care of, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m heartened to hear you say that,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. But the workings of the Delurididug Travel Network are highly proprietary. We can\u2019t contract third-party labor. I can\u2019t even discuss issues of procurement with non-Delurididug parties.\u201d\n Chakotay did his best to push down his rising frustration and disappointment. \u201cWell, if you aren\u2019t interested in our material wealth, and you don\u2019t want help with your wormholes, what are you interested in?\u201d\n \u201cWhy, intellectual property, of course!\u201d\n \u201cOf what sort?\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cAll sorts! Charts, schematics, scientific treatises, genomic and proteomic sequences, artistic and cultural works, you name it!\u201d\n Chakotay smiled. Voyager had detailed star charts from all four quadrants of the galaxy, a vast cultural database cataloging works from thousands of distinct civilizations, and similarly vast scientific and medical databases to match. If those were things the Delurididug valued, then the crew of Voyager was about to be VIPs. \u201cIn that case, Mr. Hux, I think we\u2019ll be able to do business after all.\u201d\n  \n \n  \n \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to hold our own, sir,\u201d said Lieutenant Ayala. \u201cAt least briefly. Hopefully, long enough to free Chakotay and make an emergency beam out.\u201d\n Janeway found his confidence refreshing, if a bit over-optimistic. \n The crew had worked straight through Gamma shift on devising a strategy to deal with the space station. The captain had ordered everyone to take a four-hour rest so they could attack the problem with fresh eyes, but then the telemetry from the wormhole started showing alarming signs. The subspace distortion that defined its aperture had abruptly weakened, and when it returned, it was far less stable. The wormhole was guttering like a candle at the end of its wick. According to their best estimates, the wormhole would flicker out in four to six hours.\n The captain called this emergency briefing to learn what all her crew had come up with to this point, hoping it would be enough. \n \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019ll be able to beam out?\u201d said Torres. \u201cWe tried to beam Chakotay off the station before we left last time. It shrouded his comm signal and his biosigns behind some kind of dampening field.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll do it the same way we beamed Lopez off of Omekla III,\u201d replied Ayala.\n Torres smiled at the memory she shared with her fellow Maquis, then translated for the benefit of the Starfleeters gathered around the conference table. \u201cTransport enhancers,\u201d she said. \u201cAssembled in the field from a comm device, a tricorder, and some kind of a signal amplifier. I could modify the away team\u2019s equipment to serve the purpose. Nothing would look out of the ordinary when they\u2019re scanned by the station.\u201d\n \u201cWhat would you use for an amplifier?\u201d asked Janeway.\n \u201cThe feedback converter of a compression phaser rifle should do the trick,\u201d she said.\n \u201cThere is no way to know whether such a device would penetrate the Delurididug\u2019s dampening field,\u201d said Tuvok.\n \u201cAnd I doubt the station is just going to stand by while you reconfigure your equipment,\u201d said Harry.\n \u201cThat\u2019s where frequency-modulated phaser rifles and a well-timed photonic feedback pulse come in,\u201d said Lieutenant Paris.\n \u201cOh?\u201d said Torres, her curiosity piqued. \u201cDo tell!\u201d\n \u201cBased on tricorder scans from our last encounter with the station, it looks like it neutralizes our phaser fire by matching and counteracting the pulse frequency. Sound familiar?\u201d\n \u201cThe Borg,\u201d said Ensign Kim.\n \u201cExactly,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWe think the station can identify our weapons\u2019 firing frequency when it scans us coming onto the station, so it can adapt its countermeasures before we even fire a shot. But Starfleet has figured out a few tricks for handling Borg-style adaptive countermeasures. It\u2019s all about modulating the phasers\u2019 firing frequencies on the fly. If we can smuggle in a few frequency modulators, maybe disguised as data nodules or tricorder accessories, we can modify our phasers in a flash.\u201d\n \u201cBut even if we can make use of our phasers, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll be able to overpower the station\u2019s defensive systems,\u201d said Captain Janeway. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen evidence of tractor emitters and holograms, so it\u2019s a sure bet they\u2019ll also have force fields, and probably automated weapons systems resistant to phaser fire.\u201d\n Lieutenant Ayala nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll trigger a photonic feedback pulse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should destabilize holographic projectors, blind internal sensors, and disrupt confinement beams or tractor emitters in a local area, at least for a short time. We\u2019ll need to interlink at least six tricorders with a power cell from one of our phasers, and it would probably only buy us a few seconds, but if we can use that window to disable whatever measures the station is using to detain Commander Chakotay and assemble the transport enhancers\u2026\u201d\n Captain Janeway began rubbing her temples with her fingertips, trying to release the tension she felt building up before it bloomed into a full-fledged headache. \u201cSo\u2026 assuming the station lets us come anywhere near the commander in the first place, and assuming the station doesn\u2019t notice the modifications to our equipment and anticipate our tactics, and assuming the station\u2019s systems will be vulnerable to a photonic feedback pulse, and assuming that the pulse will give us enough time to reconfigure our equipment, and assuming our phasers will be capable of disabling any remaining defenses, and assuming an improvised transport enhancer will be capable of penetrating the station\u2019s dampening field\u2026 we\u2019ll be home free?\u201d she said. \u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d\n \u201cEven if we are able to get Chakotay off of the station, it is unlikely that the station will allow us to escape through the wormhole,\u201d said Tuvok.\n"}
{"text": "Janeway sighed. \u201cRight. Let\u2019s table this option for now. Ayala, Paris, you came up with some good ideas under the circumstances, but it just isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d\n Paris and Ayala exchanged a look, disappointed, but not surprised. They\u2019d been working on this plan all night. They probably knew better than anyone all the ways it could go wrong.\n \u201cUnderstood, sir,\u201d said Lieutenant Ayala.\n Janeway nodded and moved on with the briefing. \u201cTorres, what have you got for us?\u201d\n Lieutenant Torres took in a deep breath, leaned in, and in a calm, serious tone, said, \u201cLet\u2019s ram a few photon torpedos up their aft ventral porthole, see how they like that.\u201d\n Janeway was not amused. She regarded her chief engineer with a sober expression for a moment, then said, \u201cSo, you\u2019ve got nothing, I take it?\u201d\n Torres let out a frustrated sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve been over the scans hundreds of times. I\u2019ve found countless sensor-invisible points all over the station. I could only spot them after mapping the station\u2019s whole power grid and looking for points where power goes in, but not out, or out, but not in. All of the ship\u2019s vital systems must be hidden in those points. The problem is, there are just so damned many of them, and I\u2019ve got no way of distinguishing a\u2026 shield generator from a coffee machine. And even if we could locate a vital system, that station\u2019s a hard nut to crack. I\u2019ve never even seen hexaburnium in person before, but this station is plated with the stuff from bow to stern, and we have no idea what their shields will even look like if we can\u2019t get a look at their shield generators.\u201d \n She shook her head and sat back in her chair again. \u201cIn all seriousness, the only weak points we might feasibly exploit are the portholes along the dorsal and ventral ridges, so my initial recommendation stands. Honestly, though, Captain? We\u2019d have better odds with a boarding party.\u201d\n Janeway took a deep, measured breath, allowing herself a moment to come to grips with her disappointment, and turned to Tuvok. \u201cPlease tell me you have a better option, Tuvok.\u201d\n The tactical officer nodded thoughtfully. \u201cUnder Federation law, our exploration of derelict ships and structures is protected under \u2018right of salvage.\u2019 Unfortunately, Delurididug law doesn\u2019t acknowledge salvage rights.\u201d\n \u201cSo, by Delurididug law, we\u2019re guilty,\u201d said Janeway.\n \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Tuvok. \u201cThere are certain extenuating circumstances.\u201d\n \u201cSuch as?\u201d Janeway prompted.\n \u201cThe last time we spoke with the A.I. of the station, it did not seem to consider itself a derelict. It seemed to believe that it was operating more or less normally, and thus it treated the away team as returning customers,\u201d said Tuvok.\n \u201cSo then, which is it?\u201d said Torres, \u201cWere we trespassers, or were we customers?\u201d\n \u201cThat is one point of contention,\u201d said Tuvok. \u201cIf the station concludes that our party was trespassing, it will charge Chakotay with unlawful entry and larceny, the penalties for which are severe. Our only defense will be a garbled transmission that included the word \u2018welcome,\u2019 and the automated activities of the station.\u201d\n \u201cOh, that\u2019s right!\u201d said Tom, \u201cIt did welcome us, and it opened the door, too. I don\u2019t see how it can accuse us of trespassing after that\u2026\u201d\n \u201cIt was automated, though,\u201d said Harry. \u201cJust because a house has a welcome mat, doesn\u2019t mean you can come in any time you like.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Tom, \u201cBut if it turns on the porch light and opens the front door for you as you walk up\u2026\u201d\n \u201cIt amounts to a judgment call,\u201d said Tuvok. \u201cThe A.I. may decide the garbled transmission was sufficient to act as an invitation. Or, on the contrary, it may see the garbled state of the transmission and the lack of further contact as clear indicators that the station was not operational.\u201d\n Janeway considered his words for a moment. \u201cLieutenant, what\u2019s our best bet?\u201d\n Tuvok cleared his throat. \u201cSo long as the station regards itself as functional, we should avoid any argument contingent on the station being abandoned or derelict. Instead, we should emphasize the lack of guidance the party received on their first arrival. The party was not given the Trade Hub Terms of Service. Therefore, they cannot have violated those Terms knowingly. Also, Captain, in the Delurididug legal system, an individual is not necessarily entitled to select their own legal counsel. The only parties empowered to speak on the defendant\u2019s behalf are the defendant himself, an agent of the tribunal, or an individual with direct legal authority over the defendant.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean me,\u201d said Captain Janeway.\n Tuvok nodded. Janeway would have to join the away team, or else Chakotay would be forced to plead his own case with little or no knowledge of the away team\u2019s strategies. \n It was obviously a risk. If something went wrong, Voyager would lose her captain and her first officer in one stroke. And yet, she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. She was frankly relieved to have an excuse to fight for her first officer in person. \n \u201cTell me, Tuvok, how likely am I to win this case?\u201d said Janeway.\n \u201cThat depends,\u201d said Tuvok, \u201con whether you are willing to bring Ensign Kang to act as a witness.\u201d\n Janeway pinched her lips, clearly not enthralled with the idea. \u201cSay I don\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cThe station may hold you in contempt and suspend the hearing until we are willing to provide the required evidence. It will keep Chakotay in detention and refuse to allow us back on board. Alternatively, the station may choose to go ahead with the hearing anyway. Our evidence will consist largely of sensor logs from our shuttle and the after action reports of the away team, both of which the station is likely to treat with suspicion. It will consider our unwillingness to surrender its technology and intellectual property as evidence of belligerence and poor character. Our odds of winning are low. And even if it sides in our favor, it will still insist we allow it to reverse Kang\u2019s augmentations, or else to pay for services rendered.\u201d\n \u201cAnd if we do let Kang act as a witness?\u201d said Janeway.\n"}
{"text": "\n \n CHAPTER 9\n \u201cGood news, Commander!\u201d said Hux. The holographic avatar of the station apparated half a meter away from Chakotay\u2019s face, startling him out of his fretful reverie. \u201cYour crew have returned for you!\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re here now?\u201d said Chakotay.\n \u201cThey\u2019ve just arrived through the Travel Network, and hardly a moment to spare. I have to confess, Chakotay, I was starting to worry for you. The operating window for that access point ends in twenty-five minutes!\u201d\n \u201cCan you extend that?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cBy the time they come on board and the hearing gets underway\u2026\u201d He shook his head.\n Hux considered his point for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll need to enact emergency protocols to ensure that our business is concluded in a timely fashion.\u201d\n \u201cOr, you could extend the window another hour!\u201d\n Hux turned his back on Chakotay while he was still talking and faced the screen on the wall of Chakotay\u2019s cell, which flickered to life with a curious glyph for just a moment before opening a comm channel to Voyager\u2019s shuttlecraft. Chakotay could see Captain Janeway, Lieutenant Paris, Ensigns Kim, Vorik, and Kang, plus Chief Vance and Crewman Thorold crowded into the small craft.\n Chakotay\u2019s heart dropped at the sight of Ensign Kang. What could have possessed Kathryn to bring her back here?\n Hux clapped his hands with delight. \u201cOh, excellent! Everyone\u2019s here. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m Hux. I\u2019ll be your host here at the Delurididug Trade Hub.\u201d\n Janeway glanced past the hologram, and her eyes locked on Chakotay. She looked back to Hux and said, \u201cHello, Mr. Hux. I\u2019m Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager. May I speak to Commander Chakotay?\u201d\n \u201cCaptain, I\u2019m sorry, but time is short. I need your permission to transport your party directly onto the station.\u201d\n \u201cSend us the coordinates, and we\u2019ll start beaming over when we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n Hux shook his head. \u201cSorry, but we have to follow some very specific guidelines here, and as I said, time is short. I need your permission to bypass standard docking protocols and transport your party immediately. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to confiscate our stolen property and send you back out of Trade Hub space, straight away.\u201d\n Janeway\u2019s expression went icy, and there was steel in her tone. \u201cYou won\u2019t lay a finger on any member of my crew until we\u2019ve had our hearing, Mr. Hux. I\u2019ve familiarized myself with your legal guidelines, and\u2013\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m really very sorry, Captain, but as I have told you more than once already, time is short! I must have your answer now: Will you permit me to beam your party aboard?\u201d\n Janeway hesitated for just a moment before nodding.\n \u201cExcellent. Everyone, please rise to your feet and collect any items you might need for the hearing. Is anyone staying behind on the shuttle?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Janeway, and she looked to Paris, who nodded and began entering commands on his console. \u201cThe shuttle will mind itself for the time being.\u201d\n \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you all aboard in fifteen seconds.\u201d\n With that, the screen cut off. Hux turned back to Chakotay, beaming with excitement. \u201cI think we\u2019ve just narrowly avoided a disastrous outcome, Commander.\u201d\n Chakotay wasn\u2019t so sure.\n  \n \n  \n When the channel cut out, Lucy and the other members of the away team leaped to their feet and set about readying their equipment. Lucy had less to carry than the others; everyone else had shoulder bags with data nodules, tricorders, padds, samples of ship\u2019s stores, and phaser rifles in place of standard-issue hand phasers. \n All Lucy had was her trusty tricorder and a standard-issue phaser. She double-checked the settings on her phaser, then unsheathed her tricorder and set about reviewing its calibration and configuration.\n Abruptly, the deck beneath her feet seemed to light up with an eerie, pure white glow. Lucy looked up and discovered she wasn\u2019t on the shuttlecraft anymore. She found herself standing on a glowing, circular dais in a wide, domed chamber. Considering the light-up flooring, the featureless, alabaster walls, and the station\u2019s holographic salesman staring her directly in the eye, Lucy assumed she\u2019d been beamed onto the station.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cHello, Ensign Kang,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get a chance to meet on your last visit. How are those augmentations treating you?\u201d\n \u201cHello, Hux,\u201d said Lucy. She glanced around and noted the other members of the away team also standing on raised circular platforms of their own, and Chakotay was there with the rest of them, although his platform was surrounded with a shimmering forcefield. The platforms were strung like pearls on a choker around a shallow depression five meters wide.\n Hux stood at the center of the chamber, his feet a good half meter lower than the away team\u2019s, and yet he towered over them, standing at least four meters tall. Lucy regarded the projection cooly, saying nothing more. After a moment, Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway.\n \u201cThank you for agreeing to come aboard under such unorthodox circumstances,\u201d said Hux.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me much choice,\u201d said Captain Janeway.\n \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Hux, tilting his head in consideration. \u201cNone of the alternatives you might have considered would have been wise, after all. Still, I\u2019m grateful that we were able to find our way to a civilized forum in which to settle our conflict.\u201d\n Janeway crossed her arms over her chest and looked the projection up and down, unimpressed with his immense stature and his casual arrogance.\n \u201cRight.\u201d Hux looked slightly disappointed at the captain\u2019s frosty demeanor, but he just sighed and pushed ahead in a rote tone. \u201cWe\u2019re here to adjudicate docket number eight-one-zero-six-six-nine-two, the limited commercial jurisdiction of the Delurididug Trade Hub, subsidiary of the Delurididug Trade Federation, versus Commander Chakotay of the USS Voyager, citizen of the planet Trebus and the United Federation of Planets, provisional officer of Starfleet, regarding alleged acts of industrial espionage, larceny, and use of Trade Hub services to circumvent native legal statutes. The defendant has the right to request an unaffiliated party from the Delurididug Trade Federation to serve as arbiter in this case.\u201d \n Hux turned to address Chakotay directly. \u201cThe defendant has elected to waive this right in favor of an expedited hearing, is that correct?\u201d\n Chakotay nodded. If they demanded a living Delurididug arbiter, they\u2019d be waiting an eternity for one to arrive.\n \u201cAnd how does the defense plea to the aforementioned charges?\u201d\n \u201cNot guilty,\u201d said Captain Janeway.\n Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway.\n Janeway went on, \u201cLet the record reflect that Captain Kathryn Janeway, Commander of the USS Voyager, citizen of Earth and the United Federation of Planets, officer of Starfleet, has chosen to represent her subordinate officer regarding all charges presented by the Trade Hub, per statute nineteen, sub-statute six of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.\u201d\n Hux nodded. \u201cVery well. The defense may now summarize their arguments in support of their plea on behalf of the defendant. Please be brief.\u201d\n Janeway took a deep breath and began to speak. \u201cThe original away team, led by Chakotay, arrived at what appeared to be an abandoned space station after passing through a wormhole deep in the unexplored reaches of the Nekrit Expanse. The away team undertook a mission of peaceful exploration, not espionage or piracy, in accordance with my orders. \n \u201cThe away team entered the Trade Hub after receiving an automated invitation to dock. The away team received no further guidance or communication from the station after docking, and so they commenced to explore the space station on their own recognizance. They were seeking some means of expediting our trip back to our own civilization, which is situated on the far side of the galaxy. At no point were they provided with the station\u2019s Terms of Service. This is in spite of statute one, sub-statute two, paragraph two of the Terms of Service, which states that the Trade Hub shall provide a complete copy of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service to all guests upon their arrival in Hub Space in a format and a language that the guests can readily interpret.\n \u201cIn spite of this lack of guidance, at no point did the away team lie or steal from the station. However, the station appeared to malfunction, inflicting its augmentation technology on my officer against her will. This officer, Ensign Lucille Kang, is the wronged party, not the Trade Hub. Ensign Kang is owed recompense for harm and suffering inflicted by the Trade Hub under statute five, sub-statute one-oh-three of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.\u201d\n Hux absorbed Janeway\u2019s statement with a neutral expression, and when he was certain she was finished, he went on, \u201cAt this time, the tribunal will receive all available evidence which is pertinent to this case. The tribunal presents as evidence the operational and security logs of the Trade Hub that were recorded at the time of the alleged misconduct, the subsequent statements of the defendant and the other witnesses, and the Aug-Tech subject Ensign Lucille Kang, which is able to act as a reliable record of the events by virtue of her illegally obtained Aug-Tech implants.\n \u201cIf the defense has evidence to submit, now is the time.\u201d\n \u201cThe defense presents the complete case history of the Federation High Court,\u201d said Janeway, \u201cas well as the high courts of Alpha Centauri and the United Earth Government, the judgments of the Vulcan High Magistrate, and the precedents established by the Starfleet JAG division relating to genetic augmentation of Starfleet personnel, as requested by the tribunal. The defense also presents the duty and personal log entries made by all members of the away team and myself, from the hours preceding the events in question up until now.\u201d\n Janeway opened the carrying case that hung from her shoulder and took out three isolinear data rods, which she held out for Hux\u2019s inspection.\n \u201cAdditionally, the defense petitions the tribunal to abstain from intrusive contact with Ensign Kang under statute seven, sub-statute seventeen of the Trade Hub Terms of Service regarding the treatment of victims of violent crimes.\u201d\n \u201cAs the tribunal has not established that Ensign Kang was, in fact, the victim of a crime, it must deny the defense\u2019s petition,\u201d said Hux.\n The data rods floated up, out of Janeway\u2019s hand, momentarily startling the captain. The data rods drifted into the center of the circle, where Hux made a show of scooping them up with one insubstantial hand. Then Lucy felt a sudden weightlessness and found herself floating off of her platform, feet rising behind her until she tilted head-first, eye-level to Hux as she drifted forwards, into the center.\n Lucy looked around at the others, at Janeway\u2019s alarm and Chakotay\u2019s outrage, Harry\u2019s shock, and Owen\u2019s obviously violent intent. He was brandishing his phaser rifle with his right hand, his left tucked into his carrying case as if he were hunting for a second weapon. Crewman Thorold was following his lead, and Tom was watching them like he was considering following suit.\n \u201cStand down!\u201d Captain Janeway shouted, and Thorold stopped what he was doing and stood at attention.\n Owen didn\u2019t seem to hear her. He pulled what looked to be some kind of modified phase discriminator out of his case and popped open the side compartment of his phaser rifle.\n \u201cChief Vance, stand down!\u201d Janeway bellowed.\n Owen hesitated. His gaze found Lucy\u2019s, his eyes entreating, as if he were looking to her for a sign that he should ignore the captain\u2019s order. Lucy shook her head.\n"}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Owen,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d\n With reluctance, Owen returned the phase discriminator to his carrying case.\n Hux looked from Owen to Lucy to Captain Janeway, his expression thoughtful. Then he shrugged. \u201cRight. Where were we?\u201d With that, Hux stretched out his free right hand for Lucy. Lucy raised her own left hand to meet his, and Hux touched his forefinger to hers.\n It didn\u2019t feel like anything. Hux\u2019s form was just empty, insubstantial light; no flesh, not even the simulated force-field flesh of a typical hologram. He didn\u2019t touch her with his finger, but with a gentle tractor beam and a remote data uplink. Foreign data spilled into her brain from the uplink, converted by her implants into coherent, alien notions that competed with her own thoughts for space in her head.\n > root:> initiate contact/\n Say what?\n > root/query access:> archival memory/\n The sense of the alien computer in her mind making decisions on her behalf was deeply uncomfortable, like standing with a stranger in the close confines of her closet, trying to stop him moving her stuff around and trying on her clothes. \n Ew. Stop that!\n She was gratified to sense that her protest had actually been effective; just the act of refusing its input had stopped it from what it was doing. It quickly changed tactics, though.\n > root:> factory override/\n Manufacturer credentials required.\n The words appeared in her head as if she\u2019d come up with them herself.\n Wait\u2026 I meant no!\n > root/factory override:> recognize credentials/\n Lucy felt a strange sense of recognition in the back of her mind towards some intangible entity beyond herself; like a puzzle piece clicking perfectly into place. Suddenly, she felt a sense of deep familiarity with the stranger sharing her closet. \n Credentials recognized.\n > root/query access:> Archival memory/\n Accessing. \n I mean, I guess I\u2019m accessing? Hey, I don\u2019t like this. This isn\u2019t me. I\u2019m not a computer.\n > root:> archival memory:> Initiate download :: range{complete}/\n No! Narrow it down! You can\u2019t have all of it.\n It was asking to copy all of Lucy\u2019s memories. She felt a strong sense that she needed to acquiesce to its request. It had valid credentials, after all, which meant it was allowed. It felt wrong to deny it.\n  Lucy didn\u2019t care what was or wasn\u2019t allowed, though. It could have the memories it needed for the tribunal and not one byte more. She wouldn\u2019t be beholden to an artificially implanted sense of propriety.\n > root/query access:> engram config/\n What does that mean?\n > root/engram config:> identify :: executive initiation/\n You\u2019re talking about free will. No, you can\u2019t touch that.\n > root/engram config:> analyze :: executive initiation/\n Stop! Look, you can have the memories you need! I just don\u2019t want you to take all of them. You don\u2019t have that right!\n"}
