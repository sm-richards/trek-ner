Projecting it somewhere on the western\ncontinent. That\nwould destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius. \nSCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: That damage would be insignificant, Captain,\ncompared to the seismic repercussions massive landquakes, and tsunami. \nGARIN [on viewscreen]: The force would raise a cloud of dust around the\nplanet, leading to a significant temperature reduction. We could be\nlooking at our own ice age. \nPICARD: Mister La Forge, is there any way that the Enterprise could\ncoax that satellite \n[Engineering]\n\nPICARD [OC]: Back where it belongs? \nLAFORGE: We'd need to apply a delta vee of about four kilometres per\nsecond.
