The molten core of our planet is\nnot just cooling, it's begun to solidify. \nPRAN: Our gravitational field has been affected. Seismic activity has\nincreased by a factor of three. \nJULIANA: If the cooling continues at this rate Atrea will become\nuninhabitable in thirteen months. \nLAFORGE: We could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric\nfissures and relieving some of the tectonic stress, but that would just\nbe a temporary fix. \nDATA: The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core. \nLAFORGE: These pockets in the magma layer, how close are they to the\nmolten region of the core? \nJULIANA: A few kilometres, why? \nLAFORGE: Data, do you think that's close enough for ferro-plasmic\ninfusion? \nDATA: The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill down\nthrough the planet's surface into the pockets, where we would set up a\nseries of plasma infusion units. \nLAFORGE: We'll trigger the units by firing modulated energy bursts down\nthrough the shafts. \nJULIANA: I see. Injecting sufficient plasma directly into the core\nshould trigger a chain reaction, and that will reliquify the magma. \nDATA: It should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety\nthree percent of normal. \nPRAN: If it works, the core would remain molten for centuries. \nPICARD: If you give your permission, we could begin immediately. \nPRAN: Very well. But before we proceed, I'd like to update our\ngeological surveys. \nLAFORGE: Fine. I'd be very happy to help you with that, Doctor. \nPICARD: I've assigned you quarters during out time here.
