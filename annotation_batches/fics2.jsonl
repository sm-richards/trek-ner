Then, she nodded.\n \u201cThe shock wave had residual tryolic waves, no doubt from the power core of the\n Garthusian sphere.  That explains the lack of an implosion or any debris.\u201d\n Williams got out of the command chair and looked at Commander\n McGrady.  \u201cMemorial service at nineteen hundred,\u201d he said.  \u201cI\u2019ll be in the ready\n room.\u201d\n CHAPTER ONE\n Captain Kalome of the Imperial Star Destroyer Gunterge didn\u2019t believe his\n eyes.  The alien vessel was nothing like he had ever seen before.  It had a large\n forward section shaped like a saucer, a large section in the aft section with two\n long protusions that appeared to connect to some kind of propulsion system.  It\n was also loaded with numerous other things he\u2019d never even dreamed of.  Kalome\n turned to his first officer, Commander Jafar.  \u201cWe will send over troops to\n investigate that vessel immediately.  It will belong to the Empire!\u201d\n \u201cAs well as increase your standing,\u201d Jafar replied.\n"}

He\n must have been in Hell.  It figured.\n He heard a noise to his right.  Picard looked in that direction sharply.  He\n could make out a form struggling to get up.  \u201cUghh.\u201d  It sounded like Commander\n Riker.\n \u201cWill?\u201d Picard said.\n \u201cCaptain?\u201d Riker answered.\n Picard felt around the back of him.  He felt a chair, with the same creaks\n and crevices of\u2026 the command chair on the Enterprise.  He must not have been in\n Hell after all.  Somehow, the Enterprise had survived the shock wave.  \u201cNumber\n One, we must restore at least partial power.\u201d     \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is,\u201d\n Riker said, standing up, \u201cwhy Starfleet didn\u2019t immediately come in and scan for\n survivors.  It looks like they just left us here to rot.\u201d\n Picard scowled at that thought.  \u201cI don\u2019t think so.  Perhaps that shock wave\n knocked out the rest of the fleet, too.\u201d\n Riker scrambled for the Jeffries tube access in the aft section of the\n bridge.  \u201cWell, by staying here we\u2019re not going to accomplish anything.  We have\n to get to Engineering.\u201d\n \u201cHold on,\u201d Picard cautioned.  \u201cWe need to check on the conditions of the\n rest of the bridge crew.\u201d\n Riker came back to where Picard was standing.  \u201cAll right.\u201d  He then\n suddenly looked like he saw a ghost.  \u201cDeanna.  I can\u2019t believe I forgot about her.\u201d\n He rushed to where Troi\u2019s chair was, and scanned the area with his eyes the best\n he could.  \u201cImzadi?\u201d  Riker heard a low groan about one meter away.  He could\n make out Troi\u2019s crumpled form.  He rushed to her side.  \u201cDeanna!?  Deanna!?\n Are you all right?\u201d\n"}

Now, we\n have to get EPS power flowing through Engineering, and that way we can see\n how much damage we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d\n \u201cI suggest we check the fusion reactors, sir,\u201d Barclay said.  \u201cThey have\n been taxed lately.\u201d\n"}

Attempts at\n communication with Vraris have failed.  The Romulan Star Empire\n has also been quiet since Feronium.\n There is a mystery about the Romulans\u2026 why did they betray\n us at the Battle of Feronium?  As of yet, we have no solid\n answers.  It has been suggested that the Romulans and the\n Garthusians are allies, but that is difficult to prove.  The\n Klingons are subscribing to this theory, believing that the\n \u201cdishonorable cowards\u201d decided to join the stronger side than risk\n a fight to the death.  Anyway, communication attempts with Romulus\n have also met with failure.\n The Enterprise has been given the task of determing the\n relationship between the Garthusians and the Romulans.

{"text": "\n \n Q-Logy\n By Jeff Stoneking\n CHAPTER ONE\n So this was what it was like to be dead?  Consciousness dissipating as the void all around stretches endlessly and no escape is in sight, and an unsettling feeling that there may be no God after all?  Or perhaps there was a God, a single Creator who had deemed that the entity was destined to spend the rest of eternity separated from Him.  Maybe this was a transitional phase in reincarnation, or perhaps the mythical place commonly referred to as purgatory by corporeal life forms.  Being dead for the first time, and seeing that none other of his species had experienced death, the entity didn\u2019t really know what to expect, though various books, religious and secular, had postulated theories throughout the millennia.  For all he knew, the entity would just as well end up in Heaven or Hell, Sto\u2019vo\u2019kor or Gre\u2019thor, or in the Divine Treasury or the Vault of Eternal Destitution, or simply no where at all.  After all, being part of a species that never died, would any of those places welcome him willingly?  He once was a God, so what God would want him to spend eternity with Him?\n \u201cI think,\u201d the entity thought, recalling that was the tell tale sign of being simply a being.  However, the thought took no substance, and seemed to touch nothing in time.  The entity was pulled out of all that was called home, all that was called familiar.  The entity thought, but only unto itself.  \u201cI think yet I think not; I think not and I am dead.\u201d\n With this thought, there was no substance, no root of any kind or reality.  The entity reached out beyond itself into the deep reaches of the cosmos.  If there was an afterlife, the entity was determined to find it.  Unfortunately, nothing answered back.  For the entity\u2019s entire life, there had been a multitudinous array of voices in his head.  The entity had been part of a great societal experiment, never being alone, never being without reach of the arms of comrades or beyond the grasp of their words.  Now the entity was all alone, thinking what might have been the last thought.  Why was the entity being punished so horribly?  Was the execution?  Excommunication?  The entity forgot the details that lead up to this horrific solitude.  There was the vibrancy of life, the wonderment of it all, then nothing.  Emptiness, space, and silence. Would these be the companions of the entity though the rest of eternity?  The entity always wanted to live forever, and kept on telling others that it would live forever, but now the thought of a true eternity terrified the entity.  The entity cried, and it cried out to whoever might listen, but would anybody hear?\n Guinan, off duty and soaking in the beauty of the arboretum, noticed something slightly awry.  She gazed over at Keiko O\u2019Brien, who was fixing her attention on planting seeds she received from Forchin.  Keiko had complained about the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables aboard the Enterprise, stating that replicator technology had a far way to go.  As she was planting yet another seed, her eyes lost their lock on her work and she looked up at Guinan.  There was something awry.\n \u201cGuinan,\u201d Keiko started, \u201cwhat brings you up here?\n Guinan had entered the arboretum after Keiko and, apparently, Guinan had not noticed Keiko, as her concentration seemed to be broken slightly with Keiko\u2019s question.  \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful up here,\u201d Guinan replied with a smile.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of those few places one can go on the ship and forget that you are in space.  It\u2019s a nice retreat.\u201d\n \u201cI suppose so,\u201d smiled Keiko.  \u201cYou must be reminded all the time you are in space working in Ten-Forward.  Of course, there always is the holodeck.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I don\u2019t go into the holodeck much unless Jean Luc or somebody else might invite me along for an adventure.  I prefer to relax in more realistic settings,\u201d Guinan replied.\n There was something awry.  Keiko could sense unease in Guinan, as if she was making small talk but there was something charging through her mind at that moment that caused her to be detached from the present.  She felt Guinan had not simply come to the arboretum to be away from the feeling of being on a star ship, but something was preoccupying her, and even though Guinan replied to all of Keiko\u2019s comments, Keiko still felt as if Guinan was not even talking to anybody in particular, really.  Guinan could not even keep in eye contact with Keiko and were in constant gaze out the windows.  Keiko turned her head up and looked out the window.  It was simply a star field, an odd choice for somebody to focus on when they just claimed they wanted to get away from the feeling of being in space.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Keiko asked, hoping to get responses out of Guinan that were perhaps more truthful.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.  We\u2019re on route to Wadi Besor,\u201d Guinan replied, \u201cbut I feel as if we shouldn\u2019t go.  I felt something earlier, a disturbance of some sort.  I can\u2019t describe it entirely, nor even understand it myself.\u201d\n Keiko nodded.  She could not describe in concrete language either, but she sensed something was unusual, as if things were not the same anymore.  \u201cSomething is happening but I don\u2019t know what.  From what I\u2019ve seen, everything appears to be status quo.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Guinan nodded.  \u201cStatus quo.  That\u2019s what they want us to think, anyway.\u201d\n Keiko did not know what to say to that, or how to even how to think she should take it.  At that moment, Miles O\u2019Brien came over Keiko\u2019s com badge, \u201cKeiko, I can\u2019t get off of duty right now to get Molly from the day care.  Do you think you could get her now?\u201d\n \u201cSure thing, Miles,\u201d Keiko replied, relieved that she had a chance to get away from Guinan.  \u201cSorry, Guinan, but I have to go,\u201d Keiko said awkwardly as she excused herself.\n Guinan just nodded as if she was unattached from the moment.  As Keiko took her leave of the arboretum, Guinan simply continued to watch out the window as if looking for something, or perhaps expecting something.\n It was not first in the arboretum that Guinan felt this way, however.  It first occurred to her moments after she left Ten Forward, as she walked down the halls of the Enterprise.  Every curve of the corridors, the nuance of each computer console, down to the locations of the Jefferies Tubes caused an odd sensation to course through Guinan\u2019s being.  Yet, all was the same as it has always been.\n \u201cComputer,\u201d Guinan said with hesitation in the arboretum, not sure what to expect, \u201cwhat ship is this?\u201d\n \u201cThis is the USS Enterprise,\u201d the computer spoke back, \u201cregistry number NCC-1701-D.\u201d\n That is exactly what Guinan thought she would hear, yet she almost expected to hear something else.  \u201cThat,\u201d she said softly and slowly through her lips, \u201cis not right.\u201d  She paused with unease, worry, and confusion forming in her brow and then said, \u201cComputer, locate Captain Picard.\u201d\n \u201cCaptain Picard is deceased,\u201d the computer responded as if giving a weather report.  \u201cDate of death: stardate 44741.9.\u201d\n Guinan leaned up against the nearest wall and the words of the computer had barely penetrated her mind and her thoughts.  Something more ominous seemed to emanate from somewhere outside the ship, something she felt and heard all around her, inside her.  It was coming closer, though she could not yet see it.  Out there, beyond the blackness of space, something was coming and it felt terrible.\n \u201cMiles!\u201d Keiko called out down the corridor.  He was walking out of the transporter room, apparently just getting off duty.  Keiko had Molly in her arms as she quickened her pace to meet up with her husband.  \u201cI was just with Guinan in the arboretum.  She is acting awfully strange.\u201d\n Miles chuckled, \u201cAs if that\u2019s a surprise?\u201d\n \u201cSeriously, Miles!\u201d Keiko continued.  \u201cI know she can be rather eccentric, but she really has me concerned.  She really seemed to be concerned about our recent mission to Wadi Besor and\u00c9\u201d\n \u201cWait a minute?\u201d Miles interrupted.  \u201cHow does she know about that?\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Keiko replied.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think I should even ask.  What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\n \u201cWell, our destinations aren\u2019t usually broadcast over the ship,\u201d Miles replied, \u201cand this destination has been kept quiet among the senior crew.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?  What\u2019s on Wadi Besor?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s the home world of the Taecate,\u201d Miles answered.  \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why we are going there, but I do know that Captain Tutizi was stationed there on the Federation outpost there, and that he and the Captain were good friends.\u201d\n \u201cCaptain Tutizi?\u201d echoed Keiko.  \u201cWasn\u2019t he murdered?\u201d\n \u201cExactly,\u201d Miles affirmed, \u201cand as far as I know, his killer is still at large, which is why our trip to Wadi Besor isn\u2019t being made public for the time being, in the event the murderer is on board the ship.  The security team is still investigating the potential that the killer may be on board.\u201d\n \u201cOh, that\u2019s absurd,\u201d Keiko said.  \u201cThe Enterprise was nowhere near Wadi Besor at the time of Tutizi\u2019s death.\u201d\n \u201cThey are just keeping the possibility open, Keiko,\u201d Miles said.\n \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d insisted Keiko.  \u201cIt makes no sense to mark the Enterprise crew as a ship of suspects.  What about all the other ships in Starfleet?\u201d\n \u201cTo tell the truth, Keiko, I am not entirely sure of all the ins and outs of this investigation.  What little I do know came from the official channels, which I can assure you.  Nobody is being charged as a suspect yet.  Nevertheless, that\u2019s all beside the point.  I still cannot understand how Guinan knows we are going there.  Unless\u00c9\u201d\n \u201cMiles, don\u2019t trail off like that.  You know I hate when you do that.\u201d\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I helped out in stellar spectroscopy earlier today.  Commander Data and I were investigating an anomaly recently located near Wadi Besor.\u201d\n \u201cWhat kind of anomaly?\u201d Keiko asked.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Miles said.  \u201cBut I did see something like it before on one of our missions, I am almost certain of that.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what are you doing helping Data?  You\u2019re not a science officer,\u201d Keiko wondered.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just stellar spectroscopy,\u201d Miles replied.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty elementary stuff, really, and besides, I think it could help me in that promotion I am gunning for at Deep Space Nine.  It never hurts to broaden your horizons, so they say.  As a matter of fact, I am scheduled to go on duty in stellar spectroscopy in an hour.\u201d\n \u201cBut you just got off of duty!\u201d Keiko countered.\n \u201cI might have to pull a few double shifts in the next few weeks,\u201d O\u2019Brien mentioned.  \u201cSorry, but this training for my promotion at Deep Space Nine is killing me too.  I am sure once we get to Deep Space Nine, we will have much more time to ourselves.\u201d\n CHAPTER TWO\n The entity searched through the expanse of nothingness.  Searching for something, perhaps another dead soul wandering though this\u2026this limbo?  The entity did not know what it was.  The blackness stretched seemingly from east to west, with no end in sight.  No throne, no God, no Prophets or wormhole aliens, no vaults or hordes of honored Klingons within any imaginable grasp within this void, not even an angel or a lesser deity made by humanoid hands.  No light, no door, no escape; the entity just drifted through nothing, and with each passing moment grew more weary and more depressed.  Where were the parties?  The fanfare music?  The singing choirs of seraphim?  The hordes of welcoming and willing virgins?  The entity began to question exactly where the eternal resting place would be.\n Unexpectedly, almost frightening the entity, something came up behind it.  The entity refocused his attention and could have smiled if it had a mouth:  It was another disembodied entity, and the entity recognized the second entity.  At last, a friend?\n \u201cCome,\u201d the Captain said, hearing his door chime but not looking up.\n The door slid and a silent presence flowed into the Captain\u2019s ready room that made the Captain uneasy.  He looked up and saw Guinan standing there, as if she were trying to find the words to say.  \u201cGuinan,\u201d he began softly, \u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d\n \u201cHow did Captain Picard die?\u201d Guinan asked carefully, fearing she was going mad.\n \u201cGuinan,\u201d Captain Riker said with slight hesitation, \u201cCaptain Picard was assassinated seven years ago at an archaeological conference.\u201d\n Guinan knew this but she also knew that it was horribly wrong.            In her mind, she was trying to place the pieces of the puzzle together, trying to reconcile what she felt was wrong with what she had known to be reality for all her life. She remembered how Commander Riker received the command of the Enterprise, which took place shortly after Captain Picard\u2019s death.  She could clearly recall each step Riker took the Enterprise along the way:  She remembered how Riker confronted Soran, how Riker found himself in the Nexus and opted to go back far enough in time to save the Enterprise-D from destruction.  These were all things that she could remember as it was reality, but it was reality construed.  However, there was something deep inside her telling her that she had just talked to Captain Picard that morning, though her conscious mind had no recollection of the event.  \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, almost as if she was merely arguing with her mind and not even talking to Captain Riker.\n \u201cHe was giving the keynote address and an assassin had bypassed security and made his way in with the team that had gathered for the conference.  The alien killed Captain Picard.\u201d\n Guinan steadied herself and looked Riker straight in the eye.  \u201cCaptain Riker,\u201d she said, the words sounding unnatural as they came out, \u201cthis isn\u2019t right.\u201d  She paused.  \u201cThe bridge, the people,\u201d she said as she shook her head and looked around.  She paused a moment and added, \u201cThe ship.  What kind of ship is this?  What is its purpose?\u201d\n \u201cThe Enterprise is a science vessel,\u201d Riker replied.  \u201cIt has been ever since the peace treaty was made with the Vulcans and the Romulans.  Ambassador Spock had brought unification to the two worlds and the Klingons have focused their forces against the Cardassians.\u201d\n \u201cI know that,\u201d Guinan conceded.  \u201cYet, I know that this is all wrong. This is a ship of exploration, yes, but it also a ship of peace and of defense.  It has greater potential than being a science vessel.\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\u201cGuinan,\u201d Riker began, \u201cI believe the stress is getting to you.  Perhaps you could talk to Counselor Troi and\u2026\u201d\n \u201cNo\u201d Guinan said, as if unattached from the conversation all together.\n \u201cYou have gone through a lot in your grieving process since Jean-Luc passed away,\u201d Riker stated.  \u201cI think if you would just talk to her then\u2026\u201d\n \u201cLook,\u201d Guinan said as she backed off, \u201cI\u2019ll get it worked out.  Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n \u201cGuinan, if you should ever want to talk, you can come to Troi or me,\u201d Riker offered.\n Guinan smiled politely and stepped out of the ready room.  \u201cTen Forward,\u201d she spoke as she entered the turbolift.  Guinan felt inside as if something without was coming towards her, as if something was coming for her\u2026\n \u201cDeath has always interested me,\u201d the entity spoke to the approaching entity.  \u201cI thought I was going to be out here alone for an eternity.  Or maybe this is the prelude to some sort of judgment?\u201d\n \u201cYou know me?\u201d the other entity spoke.  \u201cHow is this possible?  I\u2019ve encountered others but they seemed to be too caught up in personal grief to even notice me.\u201d\n \u201cAh, good friends are friends forever,\u201d the entity said, \u201cmon capitaine.\u201d\n \u201cQ!\u201d the other entity spoke, recalling at once that he was Jean-Luc Picard.  \u201cWhat madness is this?  What have you gotten me into now?\u201d\n In a flash, the blackness vanished and Q and Jean-Luc were standing on a hillside, the breeze blowing, the trees waving, the grass beneath them, and the sun shining high in the sky.  It reminded Jean-Luc of his home in France.  \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Picard demanded, finding that now he had a body, or at least a representation of what was his body.\n \u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d Q replied, \u201cand your life is about to pass before your eyes, starting with your old stomping grounds.\u201d  He yawned.  \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be as droll as you; wake me when it\u2019s over.\u201d\n \u201cDead?\u201d Picard echoed.  He remembered being shot, Worf immediately firing upon the assassin, Beverly looking into his eyes during his last moments of life, floating up, seeing his body with Beverly over him along with the other people who had gathered to hear his address, and then he floated out of the ship. He floated out past the stars, into the blackness where he met Q.\n \u201cDeader than a door nail,\u201d Q replied.  \u201cThis is my first time dead, too.  You know, I was rather concerned at the start of it all.  I thought I was in human Hell, what with that horrible feeling of isolation and all, but I had no idea why your God would want to send me there, especially since I had done so much work to help His poor, pathetic people.  Then I saw you and I knew that I must be in Heaven.\u201d  Q smiled warmly as he approached Jean-Luc and put his hand on Jean-Luc\u2019s right shoulder.  \u201cJust think, mon capitaine, an eternity together!\u201d\n \u201cYou were right the first time,\u201d Picard grumbled as he removed Q\u2019s hand from his shoulder.  \u201cThis must be Hell.\u201d\n Q rolled his eyes.  \u201cFor once you think you would show a little gratitude!  After all, I was trying to help you out!\u201d\n \u201cYou can help me out by returning me to my ship!\u201d\n \u201cI am just as human as you, Picard,\u201d Q replied dryly.  \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?  I came aboard your ship seeking to help you after the Continuum stripped me of my powers but you whined and put me in the brig then the Calamarain came.  They took me, tortured me, and left me for dead on some God forsaken moon.  After that, I was passed from race to race, species to species, being tortured not only for things I had done but also for things the other members of the Continuum had done.  I was actually relieved when the Taecate executed me.\u201d\n \u201cI hope you\u2019re satisfied, Q,\u201d Picard said irately.  \u201cYou always wanted to find out all you could about humans and now you get to find out about death.  I hope you\u2019re learning something.\u201d\n \u201cNone of this would have happened if you had been more cooperative when I came aboard your ship,\u201d Q advised.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Picard demanded.\n \u201cI came aboard to help you, Picard,\u201d Q stated.  \u201cYou know, a funny thing happened to me on my way to eternity-the Continuum showed me what things might have been like had I lived.  One thing that would have been different is that you would still exist in your limited existence in time.\u201d\n \u201cQ, I am not interested in\u2026,\u201d Picard began to say.\n \u201cOh, but you should be, mon capitaine,\u201d Q replied.  \u201cIf I had lived, it would have meant that somebody from your crew was able to save me from the Calamarain and then the Continuum would have restored my powers.  I could have been there to save you from your assassin.\u201d  Picard looked at Q with unbelief.  \u201cTrust me.  That is the way it would have worked out.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d rather see you dead and out of our way,\u201d Picard said with a sardonic smile.  \u201cI guess if I had to die as a result then that is a small price to pay.\u201d\n \u201cThere you go again, Picard,\u201d Q sighed.  \u201cYou do wound me.  I have only wanted to help you; I have always held your best interest in mind.\u201d\n \u201cThank you for your concern, Q, but we can manage just fine without you,\u201d Picard asserted.  \u201cThe last thing humanity needs is your superior attitude directing our lives!\u201d\n \u201cYou know,\u201d Q said nostalgically, \u201cthat is exactly what John F. Kennedy told me just before he decided to go on his joy ride through Dallas on November 22, 1963.  When he died, I was swimming in the waters of Orxim Theta.  Where were you?\u201d\n \u201cQ\u2026,\u201d Picard began irately.\n \u201cHumanity has never appreciated me,\u201d Q continued.  \u201cI tried to tell Hitler that he could make it as an artist but do you think he listened?  Humph!  You and he have a lot in common, Picard.  I remember when\u2026\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\n \n PART 1\n Stardate 77372.14\n Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of his starship, the USS Lexington. He looked out at the gargantuan Borg vessel on the viewscreen. \u201cCaptain, the Borg seem unaware of our presence, but their scans are increasing\u201d said his operations officer, \u201cMaintain Grey-mode Protocol\u201d he ordered. The ship was following the Borg Cube trying to divert it from its course to Earth. Starfleet was bogged down with the Borg in other sectors and even with help from the Klingons and Romulans, they were not making much headway. Planet after planet in system after system were falling to the Borg. a siren alerted at the tactical status, \u201cCaptain, we\u2019ve been detected, Borg vessel altering course to an attack position\u201d reported his tactical officer, \u201cFull shields and weapons, fire\u201d he ordered. The Borg vessel was faster as his crew bustled. The first shot was staggering. Explosions rocked the vessel, throwing the Captain to the floor. \u201cDamage report\u201d demanded the Captain, staggering to his feet, \u201cHull breach on deck 24, main power to 15%, secondary power and emergency back-ups are destroyed, weapons are offline, shields are at 27%, Sir\u201d shouted his tactical officer, \u201cNumber 1\u201d he shouted, mimicking an old mentor and role model. His first officer was dead under some debris. The ops officer shouted up, \u201cCaptain, what\u2019s left of the sensors are detecting tachyon emissions \u201c. The Captain ignored that and shouted, \u201cHelm, all forward, lay in a collision course, Lieutenant, drop an emergency beacon with information about what happened here\u201d he ordered to his bridge staff, \u201cBridge to Main Engineering, shunt all available power to the impulse engines on my mark\u201d he said. He took a deep breath to calm himself, \u201cMark\u201d he said, \u201cPower shunted, Captain\u201d said the Chief Engineer. \u201cHelm, Engage\u201d he said. The ship moved forward, disintegrating as it went, the computers warning system kicked in, \u201cWarning, collision detected, impact in 30 seconds\u201d. The Captain watched with resignation as the Borg ship completely filled the viewscreen. Just before impact he saw a bright light, then lost consciousness.\n Stardate 48905.72. USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Earth\n Captain Jean-Luc Picard sat face to face with Admiral Edward Robertson. Sat next to him was Commander William Riker. The Admiral was briefing the Enterprise command officers as to their mission, \u201cCaptain, you understand this mission is to be classified, news of the possible return of the Borg could destabilise the Quadrant. Given that previous Borg attacks have been targeted at humanity, it might give those hostile to Starfleet the excuse they have been looking for to launch assaults along the Federation Borders\u201d said the Admiral, \u201cUnderstood, Sir, shall we be on our way, time is critical if it is indeed the Borg\u201d said Picard. The wizened Admiral nodded, \u201cVery well, Captain, I pray that I\u2019m wrong\u201d said the Admiral. The Admiral stood, shaking hands with Picard and Riker before leaving the briefing room. Before Picard or Riker could say anything, Lieutenant Commander Data contacted them, \u201cData to Picard, Captain, internal sensors are reading massive tachyon and chronoton emissions on deck 4\u201d he said. Picard and Riker looked at each other, \u201cAre you sure, Mr Data\u201d said Picard, \u201cQuite certain, Captain, the emissions seem to be occurring in an area about the size of a humanoid male about 6 feet tall\u201d said Data. \u201cVery well, Mr Data, have a security detail meet me and Commander Riker on deck 4\u201d said Picard, leaving the briefing room with Commander Riker close behind.\n 5 minutes later, Picard, Riker and the security forces sent by Data and Worf were at the area where the tachyons were concentrated. The corridor seemed normal. Nothing seemed out of place, \u201cPicard to Data, we have arrived at the area you directed us to, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything here\u201d he said. There was slight interference when Data responded, \u201cCaptain, the emissions are concentrating into one area, you might see something in the next few minutes\u201d said Data, through the interference. They did.\n As the emissions condensed and concentrated, a bright light filled the corridor. When it cleared enough for the crew to look, a man lay on the deck. His uniform wasn\u2019t recognisable, but the insignia showed he was a Starfleet officer. \u201cMedical scan\u201d ordered Picard. He watched the medic scanning the new man, and looked at him with a comparative eye. Whereas his uniform was black all the way up to the shoulder with red on the shoulders and a blue collar showing with his four command pips, the strangers uniform was black up to the shoulder where the shoulder pads turned grey. The collar was red and Captain Picard noticed that he was looking at another Starfleet Captain. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, Captain\u201d said a Security Ensign, \u201cPicard to Transporter Room Three, two to beam directly to sickbay\u201d said the Captain. They both dissolved and left the Commander and the security team on the deck. \u201cPicard to Riker, return to the bridge and set a course for Ceridian III, Warp 6\u201d said the Captain as Doctor Beverley Crusher examined her patient. The Captain watched the bustle quietly as they worked to heal the man\u2019s extensive injuries. Thirty minutes later, the medical team stepped away from the patient, \u201cI\u2019ve stabilized him for the moment, but he is very weak. The next hour should determine his rate of recovery\u201d she said. The Captain pondered the situation, \u201cCan you wake him\u201d he asked. The Doctor looked at him again, \u201cYes, of course, but he will be very weak\u201d she replied.\n Captain Mark Smith was slowly becoming aware of his surroundings. It took him a few seconds to realize that he shouldn\u2019t be able to become aware of his surroundings at all. He tentatively opened his eyes and saw a face that he hadn\u2019t seen in the 20 years since his death. Captain Jean-Luc Picard stood over him. This was impossible as the Captain had been dead for 20 years. \u201cMy name is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise\u201d he said briskly, \u201cI know who you are, Sir\u201d said Smith weakly, \u201cI\u2019m Captain Mark Smith, USS Lexington\u201d he said. Before the Captain could reply, Smith fed him the vital piece of information, \u201cCaptain, I grew up on this ship, I think I have travelled back in time\u201d he said. Picard didn\u2019t seem surprised, \u201cYes, we observed tachyon emissions around the time and place you were discovered. But who are you to have grown up aboard the Enterprise\u201d said Picard. Smith sighed, \u201cMy dad was the Deputy Chief Engineer who was killed in an EPS explosion when I was eleven\u201d said Smith, \u201cYes, Lieutenant Smith was killed a week ago, Mr LaForge is trying to find out exactly what caused the explosion. Counsellor Troi is working with, erm, you\u201d said Picard. There was a moment of awkward silence between the Captains. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Stardate where you\u2019re from\u201d said Picard. Smith cleared his throat, \u201c77371.95\u201d he said. The Captain sighed, \u201cWhat\u2019s Starfleet doing 40 years from now\u201d said Picard, genuinely interested, \u201cWell, Sir, there is lots I can\u2019t say because of the Temporal Prime Directive. I couldn\u2019t tell you much about the next forty years. However, for the last two years in my time, the Federation has been plagued by the Borg. The USS Alaska monitored several temporal distortions around the badlands, and a number of them had Borg signatures. When the Borg started hitting Federation colonies, the temporal schisms became a low priority\u201d said Smith. Picard looked at him, looking ever so slightly haunted at the mention of the Borg, \u201cWhat were you doing when you ended up on the Enterprise\u201d asked Picard. Smith wracked his brain, \u201cI believe that we were following a Borg vessel when we were detected. My ship was heavily damaged so I ordered all power to be diverted to the impulse engines and lay in a collision course\u201d said Smith. Picard responded instantly, \u201cCaptain, we are on a mission to investigate the sudden appearance of Borg vessels in the Ceridian System. There have been no Borg incursions since the Battle of Wolf 359, but a deep space sensor relay suddenly picked up about 20 signatures. The Enterprise has been sent to investigate\u201d said Picard. Smith frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s the precise Stardate, Sir\u201d said Smith, \u201c48905.72\u201d replied Picard. Smith suddenly had all his fears confirmed, \u201cCaptain, my recollection of this Stardate is the Enterprise going to Starbase 384 for weapons system refits\u201d said Smith. Picard looked at him, \u201cYes, but Admiral Robertson redirected us to investigate the readings from the deep space sensor array\u201d said Picard, equally concerned. \u201cIt would appear that some event has changed the timelines, quite possibly starting with the Borg invasion in my time, leading to the destruction of my ship to my appearance aboard the Enterprise\u201d said Smith.\n On the bridge Commander Riker was looking at the sensors with Data. \u201cWhat could be causing these readings, Mr Data\u201d said Riker. Data made a face that almost looked pensive, \u201cThe parameters do not conform to that of any known sub-space or temporal distortions currently on record, Sir\u201d said Data. Riker considered his options, \u201cAny theories\u201d he said. Before data responded, Worf spoke up, \u201cCommander, there is a Borg signature emanating from the distortion. A Gravimetric distortion extending from the main disturbance\u201d he said. Before the commander could give an order, the ship was enveloped in the gravimetric disturbance. \u201cRed alert, Captain Picard to the bridge\u201d said Riker, \u201cAll engines, full reverse\u201d he ordered. The ship shuddered violently as the helm officer carried out Riker\u2019s orders, \u201cCommander, engines are at full reverse, it\u2019s not having any effect\u201d said the helm officer.\n Down in sickbay, Captain Picard was deliberating with Captain Smith, \u201cCaptain, come with me\u201d said Picard. The Captains left the sickbay and walked towards the bridge. \u201cPicard to the Bridge, Number One, what\u2019s the situation\u201d said Picard. \u201cWe are caught in a gravimetric distortion expanding from a larger anomaly. Mr Worf has detected a Borg signature and Mr Data has no theories. Engines are at full reverse but it\u2019s not having any effect\u201d said Riker. Picard sighed, \u201cUnderstood\u201d he said.\n Riker was watching the situation evolve in front of him. \u201cBridge to LaForge, I need more power to the impulse drive\u201d said Riker urgently as the ship shook more violently, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can, Sir, but if we keep this up the manifolds will rupture and we\u2019ll be dead in the water\u201d said Commander LaForge. The turbolift doors hissed open and Captain Picard stepped out with the other Captain, Riker was aware of the ripple of unease at the stranger on the bridge. \u201cReport, Commander\u201d said Picard, \u201cSir our best indication is that a Borg vessel is about to emerge from the distortion, there are chronoton emissions emanating from the distortion\u201d said Riker, he looked at the other Captain, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this distortion could also lead to your time, Sir\u201d said Riker. Picard looked to Smith, \u201cSuggestions\u201d he said. Smith thought for a second. \u201cMr Data, can you display sensor readings or the distortion on the main viewer\u201d said Smith. Data complied instantly and Smith studied the readings, \u201cThis looks like a Borg Transwarp conduit, but the readings are unusual. Commander Riker\u2019s assessment is correct, Sir, this distortion could indeed lead to my time\u201d said Smith. He walked over to Worf, \u201cCommander, launch a photon torpedo at these coordinates , prime it to explode on arrival. The antimatter discharge may break the ship free, helm reduce power before the manifolds rupture\u201d he said, walking back to Picard and Riker at the centre of the bridge. He looked at Picard, \u201cReady, Sir, that should free the Enterprise from the distortion field\u201d he said. Picard nodded, \u201cMr Worf, fire torpedoes\u201d said Picard. Worf nodded, \u201cFiring, Captain\u201d. The torpedo flew from the ship, exploding right on target, \u201cCaptain, gravimetric distortion is weakening\u201d reported Data, \u201cHelm full reverse\u201d said Picard.\n As the Enterprise  reversed away from the distortion, a Borg vessel protruded from it. The vessel was enormous in size and scope. \u201cCaptain, engines are overtaxed from the effort of escaping the distortion, we must power down or the impulse manifolds will rupture\u201d said the helm officer. Picard focused on the helm officer, \u201cWarp Engines\u201d he questioned. The helm officer checked, \u201cNo, Captain, the gravimetric disturbances are interfering with the warp bubble I can\u2019t get it to stabilize\u201d said the helm officer. Smith stepped in, \u201cEnsign, is there a way to reduce the warp profile of the Enterprise\u201d said Smith. The Ensign thought for a second, \u201cYes but we can\u2019t do it from here\u201d she said, \u201c there is a malfunction in the command relays, it will have to be done from Main Engineering\u201d she said. Picard stood, tapping his communicator, \u201cPicard to Engineering, Mr LaForge, find a way to lower the warp profile of the ship\u201d he said. The Borg ship continued to emerge from the distortion when LaForge contacted them again, \u201cLaForge to Bridge, warp profile should be concealed\u201d said LaForge. The Borg vessel was fully out of the distortion and the distortion was dissipating. \u201cScan the vessel, Mr Data\u201d said Picard. Data scanned the Borg ship. \u201cIt is larger than the Borg vessels we have encountered so far, but its structure is perfectly geometric. There is a large section of damage to the vessel, indicating that a starship similar in size to the Enterprise collided with the ship\u201d said Data. A sound of anguish and pain came from Captain Smith. The crew looked at him, \u201cRemember what I said, Captain. The last thing I remember before waking up on deck 4 was my ship being heavily damaged in a Borg attack as a Borg vessel headed for Earth. I rammed the Borg to try and destroy them. I failed\u201d said Captain Smith, sinking to his knees. A beeping cut through the tension on the bridge, \u201cCaptain, we are being hailed\u201d said Worf. Captain Smith still knelt on the bridge, head held in shame, Captain Picard stood and walked forwards. Before he could order the channel open Worf said, \u201cWe are being scanned, Sir\u201d. Picard looked at the damaged vessel, \u201cOpen a channel\u201d he said. The screen showed an image of a terrible creature. It looked like a woman, only it had tubes sticking out of the crown of its head. Captain Picard and Captain Smith recognised it as a Borg queen. Her face showed an expression that had she not been an emotionless cybernetic abomination would have been likened to imperious and smug. \u201cLocutus\u201d she said to Picard. Picard\u2019s face stonewalled, \u201cThat is not my name\u201d he said, \u201cWhy do you resist us, Locutus, you know what we are capable of\u201d she said. The bridge was quiet as Captain Picard and the Borg queen faced off. \u201cLucky for you, Locutus, we are not interested in you today\u201d said the Borg queen suddenly. \u201cThen what do you want\u201d demanded Picard, coldly. She almost smiled, \u201cCaptain Mark Smith\u201d she said, the words carefully measured for maximum effect. Picard\u2019s gaze swung toward Smith briefly, \u201cAnd if we refuse\u201d said Picard. The Borg queen didn\u2019t answer straight away. After a couple of seconds she said, \u201cDeck 14 is now overrun with drones. If you do not had us Mark Smith, they will force visual and audio imagery of the slow assimilation of your crew until you change your mind\u201d she said. Before Picard could respond, Smith stood, rage filling his thoughts. \u201cYou want me? Fine. Prepare to receive me, but if you want an easy assimilation subject, no if you expect an easy assimilation target then prepare for the biggest resistance you have ever encountered\u201d said Smith. Picard flashed him a steely glare. \u201cYou\u2019re threats are irrelevant, you know I won\u2019t sacrifice a member of my crew\u201d said Picard. Smith shot Picard an equally steely glare, \u201cWith respect, Captain Picard, the lives of the crew aboard this ship are worth more than mine. I lost my ship and all my crew are dead, so I will do anything to protect this ship and this crew\u201d said Smith. Before Picard could respond the Borg queen smiled, that same mechanic, mirthless smile. \u201cNot all of your crew are dead, Captain\u201d she said.\n To be continued\u2026"}

{"text": "\n \n PART 2\n Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Captain Mark Smith stood at a critical turning point. The Borg had placed a demand for Captain Smith. Captain Picard knew that handing him over would only mean that the Borg would chase the Enterprise until they recaptured him. Picard also had a hostage situation on deck 14 where the malicious Borg queen had transported scores of drones aboard as leverage to get what they wanted. Picard was trying to maintain control of a hot-headed Captain Smith who wanted to rescue the remnants of his crew. \u201cIf you have my crew, show me\u201d demanded Smith. The Borg queen didn\u2019t respond, other than moving aside to show two drones holding a struggling figure of a woman in the same uniform as him. \u201cMark\u201d came the struggled gasps of the woman. Again Captain Smith fell to his knees as he recognised Lieutenant Commander Alyssa Smith, his wife\u201d. The Borg queen again stepped back into the picture, \u201cWill you join us, Smith\u201d asked the queen, knowing she had the Enterprise crew and Smith backed into a corner. Knowing the situation was beyond him, Smith looked to Picard, \u201cCaptain\u201d he said, resigned and defeated. Picard looked to him, \u201cI cannot allow you to leave this ship, the Borg will just come after us again regardless, but then again, I cannot expect you to abandon your crew\u201d said Picard, \u201cSir, we can\u2019t save them\u201d said Smith, \u201cThe Enterprise is more important\u201d he said. Riker exploded, \u201cHow can you abandon them to assimilation\u201d. Smith glared at him, \u201cI don\u2019t do it easily, Commander, that\u2019s my wife on the screen, but here and now I have a duty as a Starfleet officer\u201d he said. He turned to the screen, \u201cMy love, I\u2019m sorry\u201d he said, head sinking, before turning his attention to the Borg queen, \u201cGo to hell, you skinny mechanic bitch\u201d he growled. The drone holding Lieutenant Commander Smith lifted its hand, injecting the nanites into her blood stream. She screamed, the pain unbearable as the Borg nanites began to alter her. Her scream was not long-lived. Soon only a shell of the former human remained. \u201cLocutus, you will be ours again, Smith, you will make an excellent drone\u201d said the queen, closing the channel. A sniffle escaped Smith.\n Worf was intently watching the sensors throughout the whole exchange, nothing had really changed until now, \u201cCaptain, Borg weapons systems charging\u201d he said. Picard wasted no time, \u201cHelm, Warp 4, engage\u201d he shouted. The Enterprise leapt away to warp 4. \u201cCaptain, receiving a distress transmission from deck 14\u201d said Worf. Picard stood up, \u201cAre the Borg following us from Earth\u201d he asked. Worf checked the sensors, \u201cYes, Captain, closing at warp 7\u201d said Worf. \u201cIncrease to maximum warp\u201d he said, \u201cLets lead them away from Earth, Mr Worf, scan deck 14, I want to know what\u2019s going on down there\u201d said Picard. Worf worked the sensors, \u201cCaptain, visual contact\u201d said Worf. \u201cOn screen\u201d said Picard. The corridor was dark, drones moved around assimilating crewmembers of the Enterprise. Picard and the Bridge crew watched in horror, \u201cSurvivors\u201d asked Riker. \u201cNone, Commander, all either assimilated or in the process of being assimilated\u201d said Worf. The bridge was silent, \u201cVent deck 14\u201d ordered Picard. The crew rippled, \u201cCaptain\u201d said Commander Riker, \u201cNumber one, venting deck 14 might spare the crew a living hell, I\u2019m doing it to save the Enterprise\u201d said Picard. Worf keyed in the command sequence, \u201cReady, Captain\u201d he said, indicating that the deck was primed for venting. \u201cMake it so, Commander\u201d said Picard. Worf punched it in. \u201cVenting complete, Captain\u201d said Riker, \u201cNothing is alive down there\u201d he finished.\n The Borg cube pursued the Enterprise relentlessly. The Borg queen was hell bent, if you could consider her hell bent, on capturing Locutus and Captain Smith. The Enterprise was going at maximum cruise speed. She watched as the Enterprise drew closer as the Borg ship was outrunning her. She could picture the resistance that Locutus and Smith would put up as they were assimilated into the Collective. If you could call what she felt pleasure, she had a pleasurable anticipation of the assimilation to come.\n Back on the Enterprise, Captain Picard watched the Borg ship closing in, \u201cWhat is our current velocity\u201d he asked. \u201cWarp 9.2, Sir\u201d reported Data, \u201cIncrease to Warp 9.8\u201d said Picard. Smith stood up, \u201cCaptain, Warp 9.8 puts the Enterprise at extreme risk, especially given that the Borg are pursuing us\u201d said Captain Smith. Picard looked over at him, \u201cWhat are you suggesting, Mr Smith\u201d he asked. \u201cMr Data, show me a map of the region\u201d said Captain Smith. The map came up at Data\u2019s station. \u201cThere, the Archanis Nebula, if we head there at Warp 9.6, we can be there in about 11 hours. With that Borg cube as badly damaged as it is, it is unlikely that they will be able to go much faster that Warp 9.6\u201d said Smith. Picard nodded, \u201cMake it so\u201d he said, returning to the command chair.\n The Borg queen experienced something that could be likened to rage and frustration. The Enterprise had increased speed to Warp 9.6 and with the damage caused by the impact with the Lexington meant that the cube could not outpace the Enterprise. The only way they would out run the ship is if they carried on for more than 12 hours and had to drop out of warp. The entire collective consciousness of the Borg was focused on the Enterprise and little more.\n 10 hours 53 minutes 23 seconds later\n The Enterprise dropped out of warp and headed into the nebula. Commander Riker stood next to Data\u2019s station, \u201cCaptain, this nebula has a high level of Particle Flux, we can\u2019t stay in here long\u201d he said. Picard nodded, \u201cHow long do we have, Number one\u201d he said, gravely. Riker looked at the screen, \u201c24 minutes, Captain\u201d. \u201cTake us to the edge of the nebula, Mr Worf, prepare a full spread of Photon torpedoes to fire straight into the damaged section of the Borg cube\u201d said Captain Picard. \u201cAye, Sir\u201d said Worf. The Enterprise moved out at half impulse, Worf ready to unleash the Enterprise\u2019s weapons systems on the Borg ship. When they reached the edge of the Nebula, there was no Borg ship. \u201cFull sensor scan\u201d said Picard. Data performed the Scan, \u201cCaptain Smith, please have a look at this information\u201d said Data. Smith had a look, \u201cCaptain, the Borg vessel has set a course for Starbase 245, it looks like it\u2019s just approaching the edge of sensor range, so presume it\u2019s moving at Warp 9.7\u201d said Captain Smith. Picard looked shocked, \u201cBridge to Engineering, Geordi, what is the effect on the warp engines from our prolonged travel at warp 9.6\u201d he said, \u201cWe have to keep power output of the warp engines to a minimum, Captain, I suggest you don\u2019t push her faster than warp 7\u201d  said Geordi LaForge. Picard turned to Data, \u201cMr Data, how soon could we be there at warp 7\u201d he said, \u201c2 hours 28 minutes 45 seconds, Sir\u201d said Data, \u201cHelm, lay in a pursuit course, Engage\u201d said Picard.\n Starbase 245\n Commodore Andre Heston was the base commander of Starbase 245. It was a quiet assignment as Starfleet had always routed invading forces before they approached the base. Today however, they were watching the sensors as they showed a Borg vessel approaching at high warp with no Federation Starships to route it. The Commodore watched as the crew bustled to the final preparations, making sure the weapons and shields were active. \u201cSir, Borg vessel arrival in 2 minutes\u201d said an officer. This was it, the battle was afoot and there was nothing anyone could do about it. Moments later, the gargantuan cube dropped out of warp. Without warning it savagely attacked the Starbase. Within moments officers were reporting shield failures and hull breaches. After a meagre 7 minutes, the station was little more than a debris field. The Borg cube silently moved off, hoping to lure the Enterprise towards them.\n 2 hours 21 minutes later\n The USS Enterprise dropped out of warp 50000 kilometres away from the debris field that was Starbase 245. \u201cMy God\u201d said Captain Smith looking at the devastation left in the wake of the Borg. \u201cCaptain, the Borg are trying to lure us into a trap. Judging by the continuing trail away from this site, it is the only conceivable solution\u201d. Riker thought hard, \u201cWe need reinforcements, Captain, but we can\u2019t take the Enterprise back into Federation space. The Borg would just follow\u201d he said. \u201cMr Worf, what is the nearest Starship to our location\u201d he said. Worf checked, \u201cThe Galaxy, Sir\u201d he responded. \u201cOpen a channel\u201d he ordered. Within seconds, the face of Captain Alex Bertrum was on the screen, \u201cCaptain Picard, how can we help you\u201d he said, \u201cWe need to get an officer back to Earth to brief the Council about a Borg invasion. But I can\u2019t take the Enterprise back in to Federation Space, could you rendezvous with us\u201d asked Picard, \u201cCertainly, Captain, set a course to meet us and we will do the same, rendezvous in 3 hours, Galaxy out\u201d  said Captain Bertrum. \u201cHelm, lay in an intercept course and engage at warp 6\u201d said Picard, \u201cAll senior officers, report to the bridge\u201d said Riker.\n Picard, Riker, Data and Worf walked into the observation lounge. Picard took the seat at the head of the table and waited, the tension palpable between the officers. Moments later, Doctor \u201cCommander\u201d Beverley Crusher, Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge and Councillor \u201cLieutenant Commander\u201d Deanna Troi walked into the briefing room. When they were all seated. \u201cFor those who haven\u2019t met our new crewmate, this is Captain Mark Smith. He commands the Federation Starship Lexington about 30 years from now and was only sent back when he intersected with a temporal distortion\u201d said Picard, introducing Smith. There was a ripple of recognition as they all recognised the 41 year old version of the boy who still regularly saw Councillor Troi and Doctor Crusher. \u201cGood Morning\u201d said Smith, formally to the people who had helped raise him to what he was. \u201cAs you know the Borg are trying to lure this ship into a trap in an attempt to acquire Captain Smith and myself, so we can\u2019t fly back to Earth, without bringing the Borg down on us. So we are setting a course to rendezvous with the USS Galaxy. I will go aboard the Galaxy and we will head back to Earth at maximum warp. Commander Riker and Captain Smith will assume control of the ship, with Captain Smith leading the Borg away\u201d said Picard. Picard turned to Smith, inviting him to talk, \u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy, taking orders from someone you perceive to be a small boy, but I promise you, I will do everything I can to keep this ship safe. I would welcome any suggestions you might have while I\u2019m in Command\u201d said Smith. Picard turned back to the crew, \u201cWe rendezvous with the Galaxy in 3 hours, Captain Smith please stay, the rest of you return to your duties\u201d he said. Captain Smith remained seated alongside Captain Picard. \u201cCaptain, what I\u2019m about to do is dangerous. When I was assimilated by the Borg, they assimilated my thought patterns and its possible that wherever they are they know what I\u2019m planning, or at least they can guess\u201d he said. He looked distant for a moment, and Smith knew what pressure this was putting on the Captain. \u201cI\u2019m going to send a report to the Admiralty explaining who you are, but I\u2019m going to classify it top secret, so you will have to get into a Starfleet uniform like what the crew wears. I also would like you to keep a sensor lock on the USS Galaxy for as long as you can in case the Borg attack. Are you prepared to command my ship, Captain\u201d said Picard, \u201cAye, Sir\u201d said Smith, \u201cComputer, transfer all command functions to Captain Smith, authorization Picard Alpha Tango\u201d said Picard. \u201cThere is no Authorization for Captain Smith, please enter the relevant information\u201d said the computer. \u201cComputer, enter authorization code Smith Zulu five\u201d said Smith, \u201cRegister information under Captain Mark Smith\u201d said Smith. \u201cCommand functions transferred to Captain Mark Smith\u201d said the cool voice of the computer. \u201cThe Enterprise is now your ship, Captain\u201d said Picard. Smith smiled sadly, \u201cThe Enterprise will always be your ship, Captain, I will just be another chapter in hers and your story, Sir\u201d said Captain Smith.\n 3 hours later\n The USS Galaxy was holding position just off the starboard bow awaiting Captain Picard\u2019s arrival. \u201cSmith to Transporter room two, is Captain Picard ready to disembark\u201d he said, \u201cYes, Sir, just waiting for confirmation from the Galaxy, Sir\u201d replied Miles O\u2019Brien. Smith settled into his chair and his new uniform. \u201cAs soon as you have confirmation from the Galaxy, beam Captain Picard over\u201d he said, \u201cYes, Sir\u201d said O\u2019Brien.\n Captain Smith was somewhat uncomfortable. The universe was in a state of temporal flux that none could predict and he and Captain Picard were now right at the centre of things. A single mistake could result in the destruction of the Enterprise, writing the rest of history for the Federation in a completely different manner, it could even destroy the Federation. As the report came in that Captain Picard had been transported to the other ship, Smith ordered that a wide band covariant signal be transmitted on all frequencies and that the ship move away at warp 6. As far as all intelligence aboard the Enterprise, only one Borg vessel had been reported, so that meant they had to keep it busy until Picard could muster the fleet to destroy it.  \u201cCaptain, Borg vessel approaching from heading 232 mark 4\u201d said Worf, his deep voice rumbling across the bridge, \u201cHold your course, Mr Evans\u201d ordered Smith as the crew rippled with unease. \u201cMr Worf, Report\u201d he said  turning to look at his tactical officer. Worf checked the sensors, \u201cBorg vessel is approaching at warp 9.1 , visual contact in ten seconds, its weapons are fully charged\u201d said Worf. Smith sighed, \u201cOn Screen\u201d he said. The image showed a Borg vessel, but it looked to be too small to be a Borg cube. \u201cMagnify\u201d he said. The magnified image showed a Borg sphere, \u201cDamn\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cMr Evans, drop out of warp, Mr Data, contact the Galaxy, warn them that they might be at risk of attack\u201d said Smith. \u201cTime to intercept, 1 minute, 24 seconds\u201d  said Worf. \u201cRed Alert, all hands to battle stations\u201d said Riker. \u201cCaptain, I am unable to raise communications with the Galaxy\u201d said Data. \u201cSensors show a second Borg signal on an intercept course with the Galaxy\u201d said Worf, as the Borg sphere dropped out of warp. \u201cMr Worf, fire a full spread of photons and phasers at a concentrated section of that vessel\u201d he said, \u201cHelm, lay in an intercept course for the USS Galaxy, maximum warp\u201d he said. He watched dispassionately as Worf\u2019s barrage of weapon fire slammed into the Borg vessel, ripping it apart. \u201cHelm, the USS Galaxy, engage\u201d he said, urgency gripping him.\n The Enterprise jumped to warp. \u201cETA on the Galaxy\u201d he said, \u201c12 minutes, Captain\u201d said the helm officer, \u201cMaintain course and speed\u201d he said, \u201cSenior officers, report to the bridge\u201d said Smith. He turned to Commander Riker, \u201cMr Riker, when we complete this briefing, I want  you and Mr Worf to prepare a fully armed security detail and lead it over to the Galaxy if I see fit\u201d said Smith. \u201cAye, Sir are you expecting trouble\u201d said Riker, \u201cYes, Commander\u201d he turned to Councillor Troi, \u201cCouncillor, what do you imagine the news of an imminent threat to the Federation would do to the crew\u201d he said, \u201c Panic them, and if we are wrong, it would cause resent and the crew would be bristling under your command\u201d said Troi. Smith sighed, \u201cOptions, we are facing a real and present danger from the Borg and I cannot in good consciousness keep them in the dark\u201d he said. Smith wished he had Picard\u2019s wisdom in this situation, \u201cWe are informing the crew, I\u2019ll address them at the proper moment\u201d he said as the bridge turbolift doors hissed open and the senior officers stepped out. \u201cThis is a critical briefing, it will be given to all hands, open internal communications link\u201d he said. He sighed, \u201cAll hands this is the bridge, there is an extreme risk to the Federation. We just lost contact with the USS Galaxy which Captain Picard transferred to in order to warn Earth of the impending Borg attack. We have reason to believe that the Galaxy is under attack from a Borg cube and are therefore setting a course to intercept, I want all stations battle ready in 4 minutes\u201d he said, closing the internal comms. \u201cI need to options. The Enterprise may be out matched by the Borg and I need ways to keep her in the fight. Mr LaForge, Mr Data, work on a way of increasing shields and weapons to compensate for the adaptive nature of the Borg, Commander Riker, Mr Worf, I need tactical strategies in place. Captain Picard may still be in a position where we can rescue him and so we must try to do so. The future of the Federation may depend on it\u201d he said, \u201cDoctor Crusher, Captain Picard may be injured if we can retrieve him, and the battle may cause injuries across the ship, I want your medical teams on full standby\u201d he said as Doctor Crusher nodded her assent. \u201cCouncillor Troi, I need you to remain on the bridge, with the rest of the senior staff off the bridge, I\u2019ll need you to act as my first officer\u201d he said, Troi looked worried, but accepted his orders, \u201cCaptain, we are approaching the USS Galaxy I\u2019m not reading any Borg vessels\u201d said the Helmsman, \u201cSlow to 1/3\u201d he said. \u201cMr Worf, open a channel, we shouldn\u2019t have met the Galaxy so soon\u201d he said. Turning his attention to the Galaxy, he said \u201cEnterprise to Galaxy\u201d. There was no response, \u201cEnterprise to Galaxy, please respond\u201d still nothing, \u201cMr Worf, intensive scan\u201d he said. Worf scanned the Galaxy, \u201cNothing out of the ordinary, Captain\u201d. Then the first shot came. \u201cCaptain, we are being hailed\u201d said Worf, \u201cOn screen\u201d shouted Captain Smith.\n The Borg queen observed the crew of the USS Enterprise with an almost excited disposition. She knew that they would be demoralized when they saw her, and even more demoralized to see who accompanied her and what she had done to him.  It pleased her to have so many new \u2018children\u2019 in her fold. \u201cYou, what the hell are you playing at\u201d said Captain Smith. \u201cPerfecting the galaxy\u201d replied the queen cryptically. \u201cWhere is Captain Picard\u201d demanded Smith.\n The bridge crew of the Enterprise were bristling at the appearance of the Borg queen on the USS Galaxy. The Borg queen hadn\u2019t responded to Captain Smith\u2019s question as to the whereabouts of Captain Picard. Suddenly she stepped aside. A figure stepped forward, \u201cI am Locutus of Borg, lower your shields and surrender your ship, resistance is futile\u201d\n To be continued\u2026"}

{"text": "\n \n PART 3\n Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of the USS Enterprise looking at her former Captain. \u201cResistance is futile, lower your shields and surrender your ship. Your culture will adapt to service us\u201d said Locutus, formerly Captain Picard, \u201cNo, we will not surrender, Locutus, you were taken from the Borg by this crew and restored to Captain Picard before\u201d said Captain Smith. \u201cThe unit Picard is part of us, he cannot be removed\u201d said Locutus, \u201cSurrender is the only option\u201d he said. Smith sighed, \u201cCommander, prepare boarding parties to recover Captain Picard\u201d he said, \u201cMr Worf, go with him\u201d he said. Ensign Macaulay stepped up to replace Worf, \u201cEnsign, target the Galaxy shields, Mr Data, do whatever you have to, to keep the Enterprise a step ahead of the Borg\u201d he said. Weapons fire from the Galaxy hit the Enterprise first. The power of the shots quickly overwhelmed the defences, \u201cDamage report\u201d shouted Captain Smith. \u201cMain power is offline\u201d shouted Ensign Macaulay, \u201cShields and Weapons are inoperative, hull integrity down to 74%\u201d shouted Data. \u201cHelm, reverse course, full impulse\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cManifolds can\u2019t handle full impulse, Captain\u201d shouted the helm officer. \u201cCommander LaForge\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cI\u2019ll be in Engineering\u201d replied LaForge.\n Commander Riker was regaining his feet, \u201cRiker to Bridge, what\u2019s happening\u201d said Riker, tapping his commbadge, \u201cThe Galaxy is attacking, we are taking heavy damage. I\u2019m sorry, Commander, we have to pull back and focus on rescuing Captain Picard another time\u201d said Smith, \u201cUnderstood, Captain\u201d said Riker. He steadied himself against another shot, \u201cMr Worf, what are the odds that the Borg try to board the ship\u201d asked Riker, \u201cHigh, Sir, the Borg only live to assimilate, it is their way\u201d he said, \u201cTake a security detachment and secure main engineering. I\u2019ll take the rest and secure other key areas of the ship\u201d said Riker, \u201cAye, Commander replied Worf. The officers walked in separate directions leading security detachments across the ship. As they went another volley of shots crippled secondary power, \u201cRight, we won\u2019t make it to the bridge, I suggest we head to sickbay and help Doctor Crusher keep the wounded alive and safe\u201d said Riker.\n The bridge lights exploded, \u201cCaptain, impulse engines are offline\u201d shouted Data, \u201cI\u2019ve lost helm control\u201d shouted the Helm officer, \u201cSecondary power systems are offline\u201d shouted the stand-in tactical officer. The assault stopped, \u201cCaptain, incoming message from the Galaxy, audio only\u201d reported Ensign Macaulay. \u201cLet\u2019s have it\u201d demanded Captain Smith. \u201cWitness the beginning, resistance is futile\u201d said the voice of Locutus.\n Stardate 48922.81, Starfleet Headquarters, San Francisco\n Vice Admiral John Adamson was looking at the report given to him by Captain Michael Thornton, Commanding Officer of the USS Akira. \u201cCaptain, I want an account of everything\u201d said the Admiral, \u201cSir, about 4 hours ago, we lost contact with the Starships Enterprise and Galaxy. Our sensors picked up massive amounts of weapons fire as well as Borg signatures. When everything died down, we detected a starship but we could not open a line of communication. Intensive scans showed it to be the Enterprise, she was maintaining position when we moved back to transmission range. Admiral, we are the only other starship within 4 days of the Enterprise, if the Borg are gathering forces in this area, we need more ships\u201d said Captain Thornton. \u201cUnderstood, Captain, you are to hold your position on the edge of the sector until reinforcements arrive. Monitor the Neutral Zone for any signs of the Romulans taking advantage of the weakened state of the Enterprise, Adamson Out\u201d he said. He turned away from the viewscreen feeling uneasy. As the head of Fleet operations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard had filed a report about Captain Smith, and the position Picard was assigning him. With the Galaxy and Picard MIA and a heavy Borg presence being noted, along with the destruction of Starbase 245, the Admiral was becoming concerned with the security of the Federation.\n \u201cDamn it, we were attacked 4 hours ago, Locutus could be anywhere by now and we have no way of contacting Starfleet\u201d snapped Captain Smith, in what was left of Starboard observation. \u201cMr LaForge, status of the Engines\u201d he said, \u201cWe think we have thrusters back, Captain, we need to test them before we can bring Impulse and Warp power back online\u201d he said. He nodded, his temper subsiding slightly. \u201cMr Data, how are the sensors\u201d he said, \u201cWe can only use short range sensors at the present time. All long range sensors have been destroyed\u201d he said. Smith\u2019s head dropped, \u201cFind a way to reroute long range sensors through the short range sensor arrays, then transfer all power from the long range arrays back into shields and weapons. Mr LaForge, assist Mr Data when we are sure about the status of the Engines\u201d he said. Riker pitched in, \u201cCaptain, Doctor Crusher is requesting that anyone with a level 2 medical qualification assist her teams in triage\u201d he said. \u201cGive her all the help she needs\u201d ordered Smith. He turned his attention to Worf, \u201cWhat about weapons\u201d he said, \u201cThe phasers are being repaired as we speak. The torpedo firing system is online\u201d he said. Smith sighed, \u201cVery well, dismissed, prepare for engine trials\u201d he said, joining the officers as they stepped onto the bridge. \u201cHelm, forward thrusters to 50%, port and starboard at station keeping\u201d he said. The thrusters activated, seemingly without fault, \u201cLaForge to Bridge, Captain, the thrusters repairs are complete, I can give you partial impulse in 10 minutes and partial warp in 15 minutes\u201d  said LaForge. Exhausted with the fatigue of defeat, Captain Smith turned to Councillor Troi, the most senior officer on the bridge at that time, \u201cCouncillor, you have the bridge, alert me if we run across the Galaxy\u201d he said, walking into his ready room as Councillor Troi sat in the command chair.\n After a few hours of restlessness, he was thrown to the floor as an explosion rocked the ship. \u201cReport\u201d he said. Walking out onto the bridge, \u201cRomulans\u201d was the only reply, \u201cOpen a channel\u201d ordered Smith. The stand in tactical officer was doing so, \u201cNo response, Captain\u201d. Smith pondered, in his time, the Romulans were allies, he even had Romulan friends, but where he was now, they would attack and they would not consider being friends. They wanted a ship like the Enterprise.  \u201cBack us off, use thrusters and impulse engines to get us inside that proto-stellar nebula\u201d ordered Smith. \u201cCaptain, if we go in there, we will be cornered, if the Romulans leave, the Borg will just take their place\u201d said Ensign Macaulay. \u201cAgreed, very well, Ensign, helm go to warp 1 and get us away from Romulan space\u201d ordered the Captain.\n The Enterprise repairs were going well, after 15 hours, weapons and shields were at 94% while Data and LaForge had managed to enhance the short range sensor arrays with long range equipment. Impulse engines had been fully repaired and Commander LaForge was preparing to unlock the magnetic constrictors and allow the full use of the warp drive. Commander Riker had returned to the bridge, but he had left security details at main engineering and sickbay ready for any Borg incursions. They were both sat in their chairs at the centre of the bridge. \u201cCaptain, our long range sensors have picked up unusual readings, I went to Stellar Cartography and ran a Quantum Spectral Analysis. The signatures are Borg, in about 3 days, the Viridian and Ceridian systems will be overwhelmed\u201d said Riker, \u201cI contacted Starfleet and forwarded the date I had, they are marshalling all ships to Sector 221 to engage, but I also found the Galaxy\u201d he said. Smith looked at Riker, \u201cWhere is she\u201d he said. Riker pulled up the data on a PADD. \u201cThe Goren sector, approaching Earth at maximum warp, accompanied by 2 Borg scout-ships\u201d said Riker with a sigh. Smith looked at the data, \u201cWhat\u2019s their ETA\u201d he said quietly. Riker looked at the information, \u201c20 days 4 hours at maximum warp, Sir\u201d said Riker. He stood slowly, \u201cCaptain, we have also been hailed by Admiral Rogers, we have been ordered to meet with the fleet at the edge of Sector 221\u201d reported Data, \u201cI can\u2019t get a stable communications line due to interference from a plasma storm in that area\u201d he reported. \u201cHelm, lay in an intercept course for the Galaxy, warp 4.8\u201d ordered Smith. The helm officer shot a look at Data, \u201cCourse plotted, Captain\u201d reported the officer. \u201cEngage\u201d replied Smith, \u201cRed alert\u201d he finished, \u201cCommander, I apologize, but hopefully this is an opportunity to rescue Captain Picard before he is destroyed. The timeline relies on it, so disregard any and all Starfleet Protocols. Submit the situation in your report\u201d he said. Turning to the helm officer he said, \u201cEnsign, ETA on the Galaxy\u201d. The helm officer looked back, \u201cAt this speed 15 hours, but if we can get to maximum warp, I can do that in less than 4 hours\u201d she said. Smith nodded, \u201cSmith to LaForge\u201d he said, tapping his communicator. \u201cLaForge here\u201d replied Lieutenant Commander LaForge. \u201cCommander, can you have the constrictors unlocked in 1 hour\u201d he asked, \u201cYes, Captain, I\u2019m just finishing the preparation procedure, it\u2019ll be done in about 20 minutes\u201d reported LaForge. \u201cAcknowledged\u201d he said.\n Meanwhile, on Earth, \u201cAdmiral, we have just got a long range sensor report from the USS Rhode Island. We are seeing a ship that appears to be the USS Galaxy as well as the USS Enterprise\u201d reported a Vulcan Commander. Admiral Robertson looked at the report, \u201cWhat is the heading of the Galaxy\u201d he asked. \u201cThey are on a direct course for sector 001, the Enterprise is on an intercept course\u201d reported the Commander, \u201cGet me the Enterprise\u201d ordered the Admiral. Minutes later, the Enterprise bridge was on his monitor. \u201cAdmiral, what\u2019s the situation\u201d asked Commander Riker. \u201cWhere is Captain Smith\u201d he said, remembering the report of Picard and the Galaxy crew being assimilated. \u201cOn his way, Admiral\u201d replied Riker. \u201cCommander, what the hell is going on\u201d said Admiral Robertson. \u201cThe Galaxy is making a direct run at Sector 001 while the fleet is engaged at Sector 221. They have Borg escorts, we are pursuing in the hopes of recovering Captain Picard, the future of the Federation may depend on it\u201d said Riker. \u201cDo you require assistance, I can have ships meet you in 3 days\u201d said the Admiral, \u201cNot necessary, Admiral, the fleet will be needed where they are\u201d. The Admiral nodded, \u201cRobertson Out\u201d he said.\n An hour later, the Enterprise was travelling at Warp 9.6 in an attempt to intercept the Galaxy and Captain Picard. The ship was only 2 and a half hours out travelling at current speeds. \u201cI want shields set to rotating harmonics, weapons set to high-end EM frequencies, prepare anti-matter spreads to confuse their sensors. All emergency and secondary power to shields, reduce lighting in all areas of the ship to 15% and divert that energy to the weapons\u201d ordered Captain Smith. \u201cReduce all non essential systems to minimal requirements and hold that energy in reserve\u201d ordered Riker.\n 2 hours later\n The darkened bridge was comforting for Captain Smith. He was used to the bridge dimming at red alert to divert power to the weapons and shields, it felt like normal to have a darkened bridge again. \u201cCaptain, the Galaxy has altered course to intercept but its escorts are continuing on course to Sector 001\u201d reported Worf. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Galaxy\u2019s new course\u201d asked Smith, \u201c334 Mk 114, an intercept course\u201d he reported. \u201cEntering visual range\u201d said Data, \u201cOn screen\u201d ordered Riker. The Galaxy looked different. Borg devices were appearing on the hull, the nacelles were glowing green rather than blue. The ship was a Borg ship all over. \u201cTime to intercept 2 minutes 14 seconds\u201d reported the helm officer. Smith and Riker shared a glance, \u201cBattle Stations\u201d they said, in unison.\n The bridge was silent with anticipation, \u201cSlow to half impulse\u201d ordered Smith, \u201cReady phasers, load photon torpedoes\u201d he continued. \u201cCaptain, the Galaxy is dropping out of warp 5000 km dead ahead\u201d said Worf. Data was looking at the sensors, \u201cCaptain, I\u2019m reading an increase of protons emanating from the Galaxy deflector dish\u201d reported Data. \u201cProton emissions\u201d questioned the Captain, confused. A sudden realisation hit him, \u201cRotate shield harmonics to compensate for Proton bursts\u201d shouted the Captain as the first burst slammed the ship, \u201csparks erupted and the ship shook heavily, \u201cShield rotations having no effect\u201d shouted Worf, \u201c5 EPS conduits ruptured in Engineering, they have massive casualties\u201d shouted another officer. \u201cSmith to Engineering, Commander, I need a way to block these proton bursts\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cI got nothing, Captain, they are disrupting power systems, I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d said LaForge, \u201cBrace for impact\u201d shouted Worf as another burst hit the ship. The crew were again thrown to the floor, \u201cCaptain, shields are completely ineffective\u201d shouted Worf, \u201cNo activity in the main weapons array on their ship, or ours\u201d shouted Worf, \u201cHelm, move us away\u201d ordered Smith, \u201cAye, Sir\u201d shouted the helm officer. \u201cLaForge to Bridge, we have a new problem, you need to stop using the impulse engines, we\u2019re burning Deuterium down here, were gunna blow our nacelles up, we won\u2019t need any help from the Borg\u201d came the shout of Commander LaForge. He considered, \u201cHold her together. I\u2019ll reduce speed to \u00be\u201d said Captain Smith. Another burst slammed the ship, \u201cCaptain, starboard nacelle is fused, there is a plasma leak in that nacelle\u201d reported the helm officer. Another burst slammed the ship, \u201cCaptain, weapon interlocks destroyed, primary and secondary systems destroyed\u201d shouted Worf. \u201cReinforcing the structural integrity grid may buy time\u201d said Data. \u201cMake it so, Commander\u201d shouted. \u201cBridge, this is Ensign Johnny Saunders, I need a clear evacuation rout for the children. There are 34 families on board presently and I have about 40 kids here\u201d came an urgent call. Knowing that he had a younger version of himself aboard he knew he had to save the kids, \u201cCommander Riker, you have the bridge, I need to get them kids\u201d he said. \u201cYes, Captain\u201d said Riker, in no mood to argue as another shot slammed the ship. Captain Smith grabbed a phaser, as he left the bridge he heard Worf shout, \u201cCommander, Shield power relays taking heavy damage, Internal sensors are failing, but showing 20 Borg on every deck below deck 10, you won\u2019t make it to deck 20, that\u2019s where Ensign Saunders\u2019 signal came from\u201d he said addressing the Captain. \u201cI intend to try, Commander, transmit orders for ALL crewmen to arm up\u201d he said. \u201cAye, Captain\u201d said Riker. Just as he prepared to enter the turbolift a burst slammed the ship. \u201cCaptain, Main power offline, not enough secondary for turbolift operation\u201d shouted Worf. The Captain instantly went to the Jeffries tubes, \u201cCommander, seal the bridge when I pass the bulkhead\u201d he ordered. Riker simply nodded.\n 5 minutes later, Captain Smith hit a blockage in the tube at deck 6. He kicked through a damaged panel. \u201cSmith to Bridge, Commander, I\u2019m running deck to deck on foot\u201d he said, tapping his communicator. \u201cCopy that, Captain, the Galaxy is holding position. No more activity\u201d reported Riker. \u201cAcknowledged, reinforce structural integrity grid and polarize the hull, divert power from shields and weapons if you have to, cut impulse engines\u201d he ordered. \u201cAye, Captain\u201d said Riker, \u201cSmith Out\u201d said the Captain.\n After another 5 minutes Smith was on Deck 14. He had climbed into a turbolift shaft and made a rudimentary rappel and fast roped down to the turbolift that was on deck 14. As he forced the door. He saw Borg working on the Enterprise and her crew. \u201cSmith to Saunders, I\u2019m on deck 14, ETA 5 minutes, Smith Out\u201d he said. He holstered his Phaser, he didn\u2019t want to provoke the Borg. He was looking for another access point. He wanted to jump the last 6 decks like had jumped to deck 14. He found it. As soon as he forced the door, the Borg turned towards him. He jumped down again and the door shut behind him. \u201cSmith to Saunders, I\u2019m on the deck, which section are you on\u201d he said. \u201cHead to section 3, Sir, Saunders out\u201d, the Captain moved on. Soon he was in section 3. He forced the door and stepped into a phaser in the face. \u201cEasy there, Ensign\u201d said Smith. Another proton burst slammed the Enterprise followed by another 2. Smith sealed the door as the corridor outside the room collapsed.\n On the bridge, Worf picked himself up, looking at the rest of the bridge crew. \u201cReport\u201d said Riker. \u201cLast internal scan showed a collapse in section 3 of Deck 20. There are 900 micro-fractures in the hull and 14 hull breaches, the Borg have repaired long range sensors and routed the Long range sensor data and all stellar cartography data with full detail as to all ships in Starfleet, the Borg fleet and the Klingon fleet to the bridge. Communications are down, weapons and shields are inoperative. Main power is offline, secondary power is at 23% and is barely sustaining life support\u201d reported Worf. Riker looked around, \u201cShut down all lighting except alert lighting and divert the power to the life support systems\u201d ordered Riker, \u201cGet repair teams on those micro-fractures and have Geordi work on getting sub-space communications back\u201d said Riker. \u201cDisplay data being given by the Borg\u201d said Riker.\n They were not aware of how the Borg were working such an angle. \u201cMr Data, how could the Borg go from emotionless to working an emotionally motivated attack. They have a concept of morale and human emotions, they are wearing our morale down\u201d said Riker, \u201cI do not know, Commander\u201d. Riker sighed, \u201cOk, what are we looking at Data\u201d said Riker. Data looked at the data, \u201c500 ships are at the edge of the Viridian system trying box in a Borg invasion force. There are 42 anomalies open in the Viridian System. Starfleet is overwhelmed, Commander\u201d reported Data. The bridge crew watched the dots moving around on the screen, each signifying hundreds, even thousands of lives desperately fighting for their lives. The only sound to pierce the silence of the smashed bridge of the Enterprise, was the crackling of flames, and the explosion of sparks from damaged consoles.\n To Be Continued\u2026.   "}

{"text": "\n \n PART 4\n Commander William Riker watched the battle unfolding on the battered bridge of the Enterprise. \u201cBegin repairs, we need to find the Captain and get out of here\u201d he said. Captain Smith had ran off to rescue a group of children trapped when the Borg boarded the ship. The Borg, supremely confident in their ability only sent 20 Borg per deck below deck 10. The Captain was trapped down there now as well. Riker looked to Data, \u201cMr Data, you have the bridge, what\u2019s left of it anyway\u201d he said, walking into the ready room. There was a morbid atmosphere on the bridge, they had just been watching the defeat of a combined force of 100 ships, Federation and Klingon, and been slammed out of the fight by the USS Galaxy, a former Federation vessel now commanded by the assimilated former Captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard. Riker sighed and picked up a chair in the ready room, returning it to its rightful place behind the desk.\n On deck 20, Captain Mark Smith sat slumped against a wall in the room where he had rushed to try and save the children trapped down there. All he felt was a profound sense of failure. When he had arrived in this time and learned that the Borg were breaking through, he set himself against the Borg, vowing to save the Federation and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant the same pain they were going through in his time. But through his efforts, Captain Picard had been re-assimilated by the Borg, the entire crew of the USS Galaxy had shared the same fate. The fleet had been engaged in battle with hundreds of Borg vessels in the Viridian system, and he had no idea what had happened to them. The Ensign who had sent the distress call in the first place was scanning the door that the Captain had sealed, \u201cCaptain, the Borg are leaving the door for the moment. Orders\u201d he said. \u201cGet some rest, Ensign, to get out of here, we are gunna need it\u201d he said. The Ensign nodded and went over to the wall by the door and sat down, exhausted. The Captain went back to self pity, knowing it was useless, but at that particular moment he didn\u2019t care. A small boy interrupted his train of thought, \u201cHi\u201d said the boy nervously. In the dark Smith couldn\u2019t see who it was, \u201cWell hi there, kid\u201d smiled the Captain, instantly hiding his true feelings, \u201cYou ok\u201d he asked looking at the boy, \u201cNo, I\u2019m scared\u201d replied the child. The Captain looked at the boy, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name son\u201d he said gently, \u201cMark\u201d replied the child solemnly. Realization hit the Captain, \u201cMark Smith\u201d he said, \u201cYes\u201d said the younger version of himself, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name\u201d asked the boy curiously, \u201cCaptain Mark Smith\u201d replied the Captain. \u201cWow, you have the same name as me\u201d said the boy, \u201cActually, I am you\u201d said the Captain, ignoring the temporal prime directive. The young Mark Smith was confused, \u201cMe\u201d he said, \u201cYes, kid, I\u2019m you from the future, so why are you scared\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Borg\u201d replied the child with a shiver. \u201cWell they are very scary\u201d agreed Captain Smith, gently patting the floor next to him. The child sat down, \u201cThey want to get us\u201d said the child sadly. The Captain looked at him, \u201cYes\u201d he said, \u201cThey want to get us\u201d. The boy looked at him, eyes full of fear, \u201cWill they\u201d he asked. The Captain looked down on him, softly, \u201cNo, they will not get us if I can help it\u201d said the Captain, \u201cBut to make sure they don\u2019t get us, I need your help\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cI need you to be my brave little officer\u201d said the Captain, smiling at all the children who had gathered around him. \u201cAll of you can be my brave little officers\u201d he said. Looking around, he could see they were not convinced. \u201cHere we go\u201d said the Captain, reaching up to his collar and removing a pip, \u201cMark, I\u2019m going to need a first officer\u201d he said, putting the pip on the boys collar. \u201cYou there, what\u2019s your name\u201d said the Captain. \u201cAlex\u201d said the child. Smith smiled, \u201cThe Klingons would say that is a strong name, how would you like to be my security officer\u201d he smiled. The child laughed softly, momentarily forgetting his fear, Ensign Saunders watched, laughing softly as well. Captain Smith clipped the second pip to the second young boy. He looked around, searchingly, \u201cWho is good at science\u201d he said. A couple of children put their hands up, \u201cOk, you\u201d he said closing his eyes and pointing. A boy of about 12 stepped forward, \u201cYou are my new science officer\u201d he said putting the third pip on the boys collar. Now I need to give a last pip, but what should they be an officer of, thought the Captain. Then he got it, \u201cNow, who has the best eyesight\u201d asked the Captain. All the kids pointed at a boy in the middle, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy\u201d asked the Captain, kindly. \u201cJohn\u201d said the boy, \u201cI name you, Chief look out\u201d smiled the Captain, giving the last of his pips away. He looked at the remaining kids, \u201cNow, the rest of you have a job just as important as the others\u201d he said, \u201cI need you all to be the eyes and ears for me and Ensign Saunders\u201d he said, \u201cCan you do that\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cYeah\u201d said the children. The Captain laughed, \u201cRight, bedtime then, a crew need s a good sleep before a mission\u201d said the Captain. Within minutes, the children were all asleep, and Captain Smith and Ensign Saunders were agreeing on a watch rota to make sure the Borg didn\u2019t catch them by surprise.\n After the group had slept for a long time to get their strength up, the Captain was ready to start his push to evacuate the children. He tested internal communications, tapping his communicator, \u201cSmith to Bridge, is anyone there\u201d said the Captain, \u201cCaptain, we had no idea you made it, internal communications failed shortly after your last conversation with Ensign Saunders\u201d said an elated Commander Riker. The Captain smiled, in such a short time he had earned the respect of the crew, \u201cCommander, are the turbolifts working yet, I need to get the children off the decks where the Borg are\u201d he said, \u201cYes, Captain, turbolifts are operational again\u201d replied Riker. \u201cWhat about transporters\u201d he asked, \u201cThey should be repaired soon, we have internal sensors back so I can keep a lock on you and if the transporters come online I can beam you out\u201d said Commander Riker, \u201cAcknowledged, Smith out\u201d said the Captain.\n 10 minutes later, the scared group silently crept through deck 20, looking for the turbolift. They found themselves at a corridor with a turbolift at the end, \u201cEnsign\u201d whispered the Captain, \u201cTake them to the turbolift, I\u2019ll hold at this position until you are all in\u201d he whispered, as the Ensign crept up beside him, \u201cYes, Sir\u201d said the Ensign, ushering the children along the corridor. That\u2019s when things started going wrong, Borg came out of nowhere from either side of the corridor section. He fired his phaser at them, taking a couple down, but they were quick to adapt, he smoothly changed the setting and fired again. He heard a shout behind him, \u201cCaptain, come on\u201d shouted Ensign Saunders. The Captain turned and ran. As he ran past a door, it hissed open and a strong vice-like hand grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. Saunders began to leave the lift, \u201cGet back, Ensign\u201d shouted the Captain, struggling with the drone. He turned and punched it in the face. As he struggled with the first drone, he didn\u2019t notice the second drone come out of another door, until it grabbed him, \u201cGet out of here, that\u2019s an order\u201d shouted the Captain, as Borg swarmed towards the lift. The last sight they got of the Captain was him struggling in the grip of 2 drones, with about 40 drones rushing towards them. As the lift smoothly ascended Saunders tapped his communicator.\n On the bridge, Commander Riker was monitoring the repair efforts, when the call came through, \u201cSaunders to bridge\u201d he said, \u201cRiker here\u201d replied the Commander, \u201cSir, we are in the lift, the children are safe. I regret to inform you, Captain Smith was apprehended by the Borg\u201d said the Ensign, \u201cUnderstood, Ensign, Riker out\u201d. The crew looked extremely demoralized, \u201cCommander we are being hailed\u201d said Worf, \u201cOn Screen\u201d said Riker. \u201cWe have your Captain, lower your shields and surrender your ship, you will adapt to service us\u201d said the Borg queen. Riker saw drones dragging Smith onto the assimilated bridge of the Galaxy, \u201cDon\u2019t surrender, Commander, that\u2019s an order\u201d he shouted. \u201cAcknowledged, Captain. Don\u2019t you surrender either, Sir\u201d said Riker. \u201cAcknowledged\u201d said the Captain. The queen smiled, \u201cWhy do you resist us, we only want to help you achieve perfection\u201d she said, almost petulantly, \u201cI happen to like myself just the way I am\u201d said Riker. The queen looked at him, \u201cBut you are an imperfect being and we are the height of perfection\u201d she said. Riker looked at her pointedly, \u201cBelieving oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind\u201d he said, \u201cEnterprise out\u201d he said, cutting her off before she could respond. But the image remained. She was forcing the communication through the Enterprise computer. That was how they saw Captain Smith break free of the Borg drones, knocking them over like bowling pins. He ran forward across the bridge, and dived at the Borg queen. He quickly snapped her neck, severing the tenuous balance between machine and organic components. That should have been the end of it, but the Borg had adapted as soon as the future cube came through an anomaly and established communication with the collective in this time. As the queen dropped dead, the Borg collective fell under the control of Locutus, who Captain Smith couldn\u2019t kill for the danger of killing Captain Picard. He jumped across the bridge and deactivated the Picard drone and grabbed his communicator. Luckily for him, deactivating Locutus caused a temporary disturbance in the collective. He looked at the screen, \u201cLock onto my communicator while they are disrupted and beam him out of here\u201d he said, slapping the commbadge onto the drones chest. The drone vanished from the bridge. \u201cCaptain, the Galaxy\u2019s shields have been raised again, we can\u2019t lock onto you\u201d reported Commander Riker. The Captain ran to the tactical station. He looked around and found a phaser compartment underneath it. Quickly tapping the buttons on the small hand held weapon he turned it on the Borg and opened fire on the few drones on the bridge. \u201cI\u2019m locking out the main bridge, that should give me some control of the ship\u201d said Smith. He checked the status, of the systems, \u201cDamn, they managed to reroute shield controls before I locked them out\u201d said Smith. A beeping came from the sensors, \u201cCommander, does the Enterprise have any propulsion systems\u201d said Captain Smith. \u201cYes, we have thrusters, but we aren\u2019t going anywhere without you, Sir\u201d said Riker. The Captain smiled, \u201cCommander, you have the Captain, and I\u2019m not supposed to be in this time period, if I remain, who knows how I could damage the future\u201d said Smith, revealing something he had already been planning. \u201cSave Picard, I\u2019ll save the Alpha Quadrant\u201d he said.\n As if to drive the point home, the Borg cube dropped out of warp. \u201cCommander, lower the energy signature of the Enterprise, they shouldn\u2019t register you\u201d said the Captain, alone on the assimilated Galaxy\u2019s bridge. \u201cThe Borg are conducting an intensive scan, they have lost the signal of both Captain Picard and the Borg queen\u201d reported Worf. Riker nodded, \u201cData, have they detected us\u201d he said, heavily. Data checked the sensors, \u201cThere is no indication that they have detected us, Commander\u201d said Data. \u201cHelm, move us away, full thrusters\u201d ordered Commander Riker, reluctantly. \u201cPut the Galaxy on screen\u201d he said, taking the chair on the bridge that was previously occupied by Captain Picard or Captain Smith, 2 men who he had come to respect.\n On the Galaxy, Captain Smith was playing with the weapons and propulsion systems. He was targeting the Borg vessel. He started to work the firing. Within seconds he was pitting Borg technology against Borg technology. The Galaxy was firing on the Borg cube, but the Borg cube was battling back hard. The Captain could see instantly that he was outmatched. The ship was slammed around under the brutal assault of the Borg cube. Sparks were flying everywhere as the ship was slowly being torn apart. In a few short minutes, Smith had watched his shields reduced to 15%, his weapons were losing power and the warp core containment field was losing integrity. He was thrown to the floor as another shot slammed the ship. The shields were destroyed and the weapons failed. The sound of a critical alert filled the bridge. \u201cSmith to Enterprise, it\u2019s been a real experience\u201d he said. \u201cYou too, Captain, good luck\u201d came back Commander Riker.  Captain Smith went to the propulsion console, the ship was counting down to a warp core breach. He plotted a course at warp speed, straight at the Borg cube and engaged. As the Galaxy jumped to warp speed, the crew of the Enterprise observed a flash of metal as the ship covered the distance in seconds. The Borg cube began to tear itself apart under the stress from the impact. The day had been won. But at a heavy price.\n 6 years later\n Cadet Mark Smith stood with the Enterprise crew in the Starfleet Auditorium. It was the sixth anniversary of the Borg invasion, where Captain Picard had been assimilated and the Galaxy crew along with him. Cadet Smith glanced down the row of the crew and saw Captain Picard standing sombrely at the end of the row, alongside an Admiral whose name he couldn\u2019t remember and Commander Riker. The Admiral was addressing the assembled crowd of Klingons and Starfleet officers. \u201cThe honoured dead fought for freedom from the Borg 6 years ago and they paid the highest price. A combined loss of nearly 10000 men and women serving in the Klingon and Federation fleets. Today we honour their sacrifice and the sacrifice made by the crew of each ship to survive the Battle of Viridian. To name the honoured would take me another 6 years, and therefore I regret that I can only name a few. The interim Captain of the Enterprise, Captain Mark Alexander Smith, put in command by Captain Picard before an attempt at an ambitious plan to rally Starfleet and her allies. General M\u2019Tath of the Klingon 1st  Battle Group\u201d. The Admiral went on naming the honoured dead, but Cadet Smith was thinking of just 1. Captain Mark Smith. The man he had spoken to in the darkened interior of the Enterprise. The man who despite his own apparent fears comforted children he had never met. The man who had showed him the true potential of himself. Of course, subtle changes had to be made to records, Cadet Smith now went by the name Mark Smith Jr and the records showed his father died when he slammed the USS Galaxy into a Borg cube. But other than that, Captain Mark Alexander Smith\u2019s mission to stop the Borg causing unimaginable damage to the timelines and the future had been completely successful. There had been no sign of Borg activity since the ships self destructed and he had even fallen in love with a young woman called Alyssa May. As far as Cadet Smith was concerned life was good.\n The End"}

Earl Grey, Hot\n  \n The professor looked out over the crowd of eager cadets and waited for silence.  They were the best and they knew it.  Starfleet Academy\u2019s top students, best performers, highest decorated.  The boys in the front were strong and decided-looking, sitting with their arms flexed just enough that their biceps bulged against their uniforms, hoping one of the few females seated nearby was looking. The girls looked more focused.  They were the ones with something to prove, Wesley Crusher thought.  They were the ones who wanted revenge.     \n \u201cMay I continue?\u201d Wesley said.  He balanced himself on his good leg to lean back against his podium and stroked his full, gray beard, making eye contact with as many of them as he could.  \u201cThis next block is probably the most difficult of all the ones I teach.  It causes more controversy than anything else you\u2019ll learn during your time here, and probably with good reason.  It\u2019s also the one we get the most complaints about from parents,\u201d he added with a wry smile. \u201cYou see, Starfleet has a way of lying to its young cadets.\u201d\n He let that one sink in for a minute, watching how the class shifted uneasily in their seats.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come right out and say it, of course, but your entire curriculum, this entire facility, and the whole of Starfleet Command, has a way of propagating this myth about what you\u2019ll experience in space.  It\u2019s all about adventure, right?  It\u2019s all about seeking out brave new worlds, etcetera, etcetera.  Nobody signed up to be a requisitions officer, did you?\u201d  He scanned the room with his finger and said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think so.  You want to be a captain!  You want to be an explorer.  Right?\u201d\n Some of the students nodded, and Wesley folded his hands behind his back.  His professor\u2019s robe was getting tight around his middle.  The excuse he gave his doctor was that he wasn\u2019t really becoming a saggy old man; it was simply the effects of the Earth\u2019s gravity on him after spending his adolescent years in space.  He lifted his head and said, \u201cWho here thinks they might die in service?\u201d\n Nobody moved.  \u201cStatistics prior to the Great Invasion say that twelve percent of all Starfleet Officers would either die or be critically injured in the course of their duties.  Obviously, we cannot accurately factor what those statistics were during the Invasion.  The casualty rate, particularly for women, was appallingly high during that period.  I am certain that many of you were already aware of this sad fact.\u201d\n He looked at them, studying their faces.  Now he had their attention.  \u201cLet me ask you this instead.  If you were going to die while in service to Starfleet, how would it be?\u201d\n \u201cIn battle,\u201d the young man nearest to him said.  \u201cKilling Borg.\u201d\n There were many murmurs of agreement to that and Wesley nodded, \u201cUnderstandable.  But the Delta Quadrant is far away and the Hive has not dared cross the border in decades.  What else besides battle might take your young lives?\u201d\n \u201cTransporter malfunction,\u201d someone else said.\n \u201cAlien disease.\u201d\n \u201cAll tragically real possibilities,\u201d Wesley said.  He activated a large holographic projection of a starship travelling through space.  \u201cThis is classified footage of the USS Janeway Event.  You will never see it again unless you wind up working for Starfleet Intelligence.  The Janeway was on a routine mission to the Alpha Quadrant when a series of misfortunes struck.\u201d  Wesley paused the image and aimed a bright red light on the ship\u2019s nacelles.  The image started to move again in slow motion, going frame by frame, so that the explosion in the ship started as a small crack along its surface with bright yellow flame beneath it.  As Wesley advanced the frames, the ship blew to pieces directly in front the class.  \u201cFifteen hundred people onboard.  Men, women and children.  Fifteen hundred lives, here one moment, thinking about their work, their families, their problems, their lives.  Working, eating, arguing, making love, sleeping, and all the things you can imagine happen at any given time on board a vessel, gone like that,\u201d Wesley said with a snap of his fingers.  \u201cNot in battle.  Not saving some civilization.  A failed reactor coil.\u201d\n The faces looked a little less confident now.  Wesley ended the projection and said, \u201cStill, mass tragedies like the Janeway are big events.  There\u2019s media coverage and boards of inquiry.  But large scale incidents are not the only kind that happen.  Not by a long shot.\u201d\n He pressed a button on his console and the shimmering hologram of a dark-skinned, bald-headed man appeared before the class.  His Starfleet captain\u2019s uniform was so perfectly detailed, Wesley could see the fabric patterns on his shirt sleeves.  \u201cThis is Captain Benjamin Sisko, one year before he led the attack on the Dominion fleet at Cardassian Prime.  By all accounts, Captain Sisko was an exemplary commanding officer and probably candidate for the Admiralty.\u201d\n Wesley paused in front of the hologram, looking into its deeply set eyes, admiring its proud gaze.  \u201cDuring his assignment to Deep Space Nine, Sisko was contacted by an alien species that occupied a nearby wormhole.  These beings would often remove Sisko from our dimension and place him inside their own, completely at their own whim.  Finally, they decided to keep him.\u201d  Wesley looked over his shoulder at the audience, \u201cHis command, his son, his pregnant wife, and everything he knew was left behind, without any warning.  Sisko appeared in a vision to his wife and told her he expected to return in a year, that the Prophets, as they wished to be known, had much to teach him.\u201d\n The next hologram showed a shriveled man being wheeled in front of the class, pushed by another of the Academy\u2019s professors.  Wesley stood in the same place he had twenty years before, on the day the hologram was recorded, and the image of Miles O\u2019Brien nodded at Wesley as it walked past.  O\u2019Brien\u2019s hologram pushed the withered man to a place in front of the class, then turned and walked away.  Wesley glanced at the corner of the room where one of the cadets sat, a young man with startlingly green eyes that slanted ever so slightly at the corners as evidence of his Asian heritage.  Liam O\u2019Brian looked up as his grandfather walked past him to leave the classroom, his eyes never leaving the shimmering image until it vanished.\n Wesley walked up to the hologram sitting in its wheelchair at the front of his class and clasped his hands behind his back, making sure all of the students were looking.  It was uncomfortable for them, that much was certain.  Benjamin Sisko was an invalid whose limbs were bone-thin and curled up close to his body compulsively.  His head drooped to the side and long streams of drool spilled out of his open mouth that contained no teeth.\n \u201cNineteen years later, this is what returned to Deep Space Nine.  By that point, no one who had served with the Captain remained aboard or had any idea he might someday return as suddenly as he left.  He\u2019d been declared dead by the Federation and his wife had already remarried and moved halfway across the galaxy.  My colleague, the late Professor O\u2019Brien, whom you just saw in the hologram came upon a posting on the Engineer\u2019s network regarding the matter and immediately recognized his former Captain.\u201d  Wesley looked out over the class, \u201cBenjamin Sisko lingered in the state you see him in for another five years in a Federation hospital.\u201d\n One of the girls in the front row raised her hand, \u201cWhy did the Prophets want him?\u201d\n Wesley shrugged, \u201cWe will never be certain.  At the time, Captain Sisko thought he was destined to fulfill their grand scheme, and in some ways, he may have been.  The whole story is never quite apparent to us, though, and whatever their reasons for keeping him inside the wormhole, he was not the same when he returned.\u201d\n"}
{"text": "Some of the cadets were visibly distressed by the image on the hologram, covering their eyes with their hands, or looking down at their desks.  Wesley paused the image and brought up the first one, of a proud, strong Captain Benjamin Sisko in his Starfleet Uniform.  Wesley stood beside the hologram and said, \u201cI suggest that any of you would be lucky to be compared to the man standing before you, both in terms of service and capability.  I also suggest that if something like this can happen to him, it can happen to you.\u201d  Wesley turned the hologram off and clapped his hands together loudly, breaking the spell of despair that had fallen over his audience, \u201cOkay, now that you\u2019re all thoroughly depressed, I have some good news.  You\u2019re getting out early today.\u201d  The cadets faces instantly brightened and began to shift around in their seats to gather their things, forcing Wesley to raise his voice, \u201cThose of you taking The Test tomorrow should go home and get some rest.  In other words, don\u2019t go out to the bars.\u201d\n He watched as his class got up from their seats and began to file out.  For a moment, Liam O\u2019Brien stopped in his passage toward the door, looking at the professor as if he were about to say something.  Wesley turned toward the young man and said, \u201cYes?\u201d but by then, Liam had already turned away.\n ***\n The sun was setting over the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay glistened in hues of red and gold, as if the water were summoning it down to rest.  As the Academy\u2019s most senior professor, Wesley had his choice of offices.  The one with the best view also happened to be the one closest to his classroom.  He looked at the hover chair sitting in the corner of the room, the same one he\u2019d ridden in as he finally left the hospital after the Invasion and returned to the Academy.  People lined the halls as he entered, the chair whirring six inches off the ground like an elaborate flying carpet.  They welcomed him home and smiled kindly as he passed, but raw pity was evident on their faces.\n That day, he\u2019d stood up from the chair and refused to use it ever again.\n Wesley sipped the rest of his wine, red and strong to the last, then lifted the green glass bottle from his table to refill it.  The label was worn and faded now.  \u201cChateau Picard, Labarre,\u201d he whispered with a quiet nod.  Of course, the wine he was drinking had not been bottled in France.  The original bottle had been a gift from Jean-Luc many decades ago and Wesley had entered its composition into his office\u2019s food replicator.  It had been so long since he\u2019d tasted the original that he often wondered if he would even recognize it any longer.  He always refilled it in the same bottle though.  It helped support the illusion.\n His door beeped and Wesley set down the bottle and said, \u201cCome in.\u201d\n The doors whisked open instantly.  \u201cGood evening, Professor Crusher.  I hope I\u2019m not intruding on you.\u201d\n Wesley turned to see Liam O\u2019Brien standing in his doorway.  He held up his empty glass and said, \u201cI always enjoy a drink after teaching that particular module.  I suppose it is my attempt to gain some sort of perspective.\u201d  The cadet nodded silently, clearly he had no idea what the old man was talking about.  Wesley waved for him to come and sit and said, \u201cWhat can I do for you, Liam?\u201d\n \u201cTomorrow\u2019s my day.  For the test, I mean.\u201d\n \u201cSo it is,\u201d Wesley said.  \u201cAnd what have you done to prepare yourself?\u201d\n \u201cBesides come here, you mean?\u201d\n Wesley smiled softly, \u201cI am forbidden from telling you anything about the test.  Your grandfather would never forgive me.\u201d\n Liam held up his hand, \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant, Professor.  I just wanted someone to talk to. Someone I could trust.\u201d  He pointed at the glass in Wesley\u2019s hand and said, \u201cSomeone with a little perspective.\u201d\n \u201cI see,\u201d Wesley said.  He eased himself down on the couch and massaged his ruined leg, grunting as he worked the tangle of muscles and cybernetics that formed his thigh and knee.   \u201cWell, when I was your age and took the test, it was still the old Klingon scenario.\u201d\n Liam\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cReally?\u201d\n Wesley nodded, \u201cSeems a little moot now, doesn\u2019t it?  I doubt any of you have ever even seen a Klingon.  Anyway, I was on the committee that proposed changing the test.  You would not believe the resistance we faced from the senior faculty.  Some traditions die harder than others.  No one wanted to admit that such an important part of their youth had become obsolete.\u201d\n \u201cBut you did change it, obviously,\u201d Liam said.  \u201cAll of the postings I\u2019ve seen talk about different scenarios that are randomly chosen.  It could be the Dominion, the Tholians, I guess the obvious choice is \u2026 \u201d the young man\u2019s voice trailed off.\n \u201cThe Borg,\u201d Wesley said quietly.  \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Liam.  You can say it around me.\u201d\n \u201cYes, professor,\u201d Liam said.  He looked down at his hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s quite all right.  I learned a very long time ago that life goes on, regardless of what you lose or how you lose it.\u201d\n \u201cIs that why you drink?\u201d\n \u201cTo forget my wife and daughter, you mean?\u201d Wesley said.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Wesley said.  \u201cI drink to try and gain perspective about losing them.\u201d\n Liam sighed and stood up, \u201cI am sorry I disturbed you, professor.  It was rude of me to come here.\u201d\n \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Wesley said, \u201cI feel honored.  Cadets traditionally visit the holodecks to seek guidance from James T. Kirk.  They think they might somehow glean some of his secrets as to how to beat The Test.  That\u2019s good enough company for me to be in, I think.\u201d\n Liam smiled with slight embarrassment, \u201cI already talked to Kirk.\u201d\n \u201cYou did?\u201d Wesley said.  \u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d\n \u201cI \u2026 don\u2019t believe \u2026 in the \u2026 no-win \u2026 scenario!\u201d Liam said, mimicking the hologram\u2019s voice to near perfection.\n"}
{"text": "Wesley laughed, \u201cYes, well, holodecks were invented long after Kirk\u2019s time.  They had to piece together his persona from old starlogs and the like.  I\u2019m sure the actual person was far less flamboyant.  You\u2019ll get much better results from more modern people, the ones who were properly scanned with thought toward living on in holodeck form to give guidance to the rest of us.\u201d\n \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d Liam said.\n Wesley took a long sip of his wine and said, \u201cOnly one comes to mind.\u201d\n ***\n Whoever used the holodeck before him forgot to clear their list of preferences.  Wesley only glanced at the selection, knowing that the entire area was under constant surveillance and having no desire to be reprimanded for intruding on someone else\u2019s privacy.  But still, the choices were salacious.\n Night with an Orion slave girl. \n Night as an Orion slave girl. \n Tribble touch. \n The Captain\u2019s harsh reprimand. \n Liam surpassed a laugh and cleared the screen, pulling up the program that Professor Crusher had provided him.  Liam took a deep breath and opened the holodeck doors.  He stepped into a brightly lit countryside, with rolling hills of green that looked down at a small village far below.  Chimney smoke trailed up from their roofs toward the open blue sky where the massive cumulus clouds looked something like a starship armada hovering overhead.\n He kept walking, searching in every direction for some sign of importance.  The professor had refused to tell him who he was going to see or what.  For all he knew, he was about to experience the first air raid of the second World War, or the quiet moments just before the Great Invasion.  Liam found himself spinning around in circles as he searched the sky for signs of movement, now wishing the enormous clouds were gone so he had a clearer view.\n A man called out to him, \u201cCan I help you, young man?\u201d\n Liam bolted upright, reflexively snapping to attention.  He quickly pulled down on his uniform to adjust it and announced himself, \u201cStarfleet cadet Liam H. O\u2019Brien, sir.  Senior year, command school, sir.\u201d\n The old man was dressed in a long grey smock decorated with slashes of paint.  His arms and hands were tinged with light blue and white, the same colors that were now running from the long paintbrush in his hand onto the grass at his feet.  Liam wondered if he\u2019d been painting a picture or simply rolling around in the paints for fun.\n \u201cProfessor Crusher sent me, sir.  To speak with you.\u201d\n \u201cAh,\u201d the old man said.  \u201cIn that case, go away.\u201d  With that, he turned from Liam and headed back toward a small easel perched on the crest of the hill.\n \u201cSir?\u201d Liam said, hurrying after him.\n \u201cI said, go away!  Tell Wesley that he should know me better than to send some cadet to try and lure me back to the academy.  I shall not return.\u201d\n Liam found he had to walk quickly to keep up with the man, who must be in his early nineties but still moved with a certain speed that belied his age.  He was trim and spry and Liam thought that if perhaps the man were not so bald he might have guessed him to be only in his late sixties.  \u201cI didn\u2019t come to lure you back to anything,\u201d Liam called out.  \u201cWait, why won\u2019t you go back to the Academy?  What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\n \u201cToo much to do!\u201d  The old man stopped in front of his easel and scowled at the image painted on it.  He sighed with defeat and threw down his paintbrush, \u201cUtter rubbish.  You would think that after all this time I could paint a simple French countryside, but alas, my hands and vision betray me.\u201d\n \u201cYou could always get your eyes re-focused.  Or your synapses enhanced to compensate for old age,\u201d Liam said.\n The old man\u2019s face wrinkled into a scowl.\n Liam turned back to the painting and said, \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\n The old man stopped and reconsidered the painting, moving to where the boy stood to see if from his angle.  \u201cI suppose it has a certain rustic charm.  What did you say your name was?\u201d\n \u201cLiam O\u2019Brian, sir.  Starfleet cadet.\u201d\n The old man held out his paint-covered hand, \u201cJean-Luc Picard.  Private citizen.  Also, dead person.\u201d\n Liam cocked his head, \u201cSorry, sir?\u201d\n \u201cDead person,\u201d Picard said.  \u201cDo you really believe I\u2019m standing on this hill with you?  According to the records, I died thirty years ago.\u201d  He eyed the young cadet warily, \u201cYou do know this is a computer simulation, lad, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cWell, yes, I do.  I\u2019m just not sure you\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n \u201cIt was one of the requirements I gave when they wanted to hook all those things up to me and scan and graph every little corner of my brain.  I insisted that they make me cognizant of the fact that I am not alive and that none of this is real.\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\n \n Star Trek: Icarus\n -1-\n The distraught young woman clad in a drab grey jumpsuit stepped out of the tiny automated shuttlecraft, hair in disarray from the penant-fluttering breeze, an old and durably utilitarian khaki duffel bag slung over her shoulder, and stopped and stared; she was wholly unprepared for the chaos of San Francisco\u2019s South Shuttle Terminal, and felt painfully conspicuous and out of place.\n She had never before felt air so humid, had never seen a place so full of colour and activity. To her eyes the intense green of the surrounding cascades of immense, towering foliage, the impossibly blue sky and the listless blue-green ocean seemed almost artificial, an assault on her senses so overwhelming that it made her feel almost physically ill. By contrast, the pale yellow\n skies, tan deserts, scrub plains and empty quiet of the world on she\u2019d grown up formed a serene, nostalgic contrast to the background of her thoughts.\n Well, she was here. Now, what?\n She had been found out and dismissed a matter of hours earlier from the Erbean deep-space freighter Gallant; the lie that had got her into the merchant service had also been her undoing. On her application she had claimed to be half Vulcan, half human. She was, in truth, half Vulcan, but the other half, the unruly, emotional half that tortured her with empathic feelings she wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with, was Betazoid. \n She had concealed the beguiling depth of her large, dark Betazoid eyes with contacts, but a sharp-eyed shipmate, the captain\u2019s willful and manipulative concubine, Farina, had seen through the ruse and reported her. Now she was dismissed, in disgrace, and without a home. \n Neither Vulcan nor Beta Zed had been an option. She couldn\u2019t tolerate the shame of being among Vulcans because of the emotions she couldn\u2019t conceal, nor could she tolerate the empathy or the open emotionalism of Betazoids, and the intolerable invasion of her own, private, personal demons. The mere thought of returning to the Federation colony where she\u2019d grown up caused her\n insides to feel curdled; there, for her whole entire life, she had been an unwanted outcast. Pure chance had decided her upon a nearby planet called Earth and the dubious prospect of finding some form of employment. She grimaced, inwardly. Her one real qualification for any type of work on this world was that she was relatively fluent in the widely-spoken language called English Standard, which in its earliest form had apparently originated on this strange world, though because of its uncanny flexibility it was now one of the most widely spoken languages in the Federation.\n The sight of the new-risen sun caused her to moan inwardly in tired frustration. By her departed ship\u2019s clock it was around 01:30 hours. This world was at least thirteen and a half hours out-of-sync with her body clock. What she needed right now, more than anything, was something familiar, or at least palatable to eat, a shower, and then bed and the forgetfulness and escape of\n sleep!\n She stared in astonishment as a woman lifted a child and held it up to what she had assumed to be some sort of local religious icon; it was a small ornate fountain with a plaque affixed to its side. The child drank her fill, the mother then held the child on her hip and did the\n same, and then they were off, the woman pushing the child before her in a small, lightweight, wheeled contraption. \n Watching carefully for disapproving looks from the locals, she approached the fountain herself, still amazed by the sight of sparkling, free-running water. She was careful to taste it first, just to be certain that it was what it appeared to be . . . the water was good, and very\n cold. She drank deeply, and was soon refreshed, but the water only served to exacerbate her hunger pangs.\n At the entrance to the interior of the Shuttle Terminal was an icon she recognised, a small sign hanging from the ceiling with an arrow, a black silhouette of a plate with a human-style knife and fork to either side, and the words \u201cFood Court\u201d underneath in English Standard. \n The Food Court was utter chaos! It was a huge open area with a domed glass roof, the entire perimeter of which was one continuous riot of mercantile food businesses. The whole entire floorspace was covered with tables and chairs, dotted with occasional litter bins, cleaning\n stations, and enormous live plants. Hanging from the ceiling in various places were monitors showing various types of information and entertainment. Each table had its own speaker, computer outlet and translator. And the crush of people! She had no idea that humans came in so many shapes, sizes and colours, that they spoke such a babel of disparate languages. There were many aliens as well . . . feeling ashamed, she tried not to look at anyone for fear that they would notice her own appearance in their turn.\n Her selection was made for her by the icons displaying which currencies and forms of credit were acceptable. The selection available to her was not great. With great reluctance, she approached a Vulcan booth, unable to look the server in the eye. To make matters worse, the woman serving her took her time, all-too-obviously scrutinizing her appearance. Feeling rattled, as though everyone were staring at her, she hastily paid the woman, moved away to an unoccupied table, ate her meal automatically and self-consciously, and went back outside.\n Groaning inwardly, she began pushing her way through the crush of people. Several very large shuttles had just landed, and more were high above in holding patterns. She stopped to look about for a chronometer. Someone jostled her from behind, and apologised.\n \u201cSorry! Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your daydreaming.\u201d\n Embarrassed, she found herself blocking a line of people about to board another shuttle.\n She noticed, then, a forty-ish man standing nearby, who gave her uniform a look, causing her to squirm involuntarily. There was no disguising a uniform stripped of insignia. To her misgiving, the man approached her. Was her presence here illegal?\n \u201cMay I assume that you\u2019re between commissions?\u201d\n Feeling very shy and intimidated, she shrugged, unable to meet his gaze, and began moving away.\n \u201cWe have several openings in commissary, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d\n The sight of his Starfleet uniform caused her to shake her head automatically. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want someone like me,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve just been dismissed.\u201d She started to turn away from him. \n"}
{"text": "\u201cFor what reason?\u201d\n Feeling as though she were being interrogated, she bit off, tersely, \u201cBecause I had to lie to get the job I had-\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n She glared at him. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell just by looking at me? I\u2019m half Vulcan and half Betazoid! It\u2019s a poisonous mix! I\u2019m unstable! Nobody . . . wants me.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to blurt it out so bitterly, and fled, as much from him as from a premonition of the humiliating tears she couldn\u2019t control. \n A hand on her arm stopped her.\n \u201cLet go of me.\u201d\n \u201cThe job\u2019s still open if you want it, young lady. I\u2019m not one to give up on people easily. And I\u2019m not one to discriminate. Working in a starship commissary is menial labour, granted, but it\u2019s still work, and well within your means if you\u2019re having any sort of personal difficulty. Besides,\u201d he added with a disarming smile, \u201cwe\u2019re desperately short on staff at the moment, and\n from the sound of things you\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d\n She eyed him, suspiciously.\n \u201cWhat gives you the authority to hand out positions to someone who . . . to people like me?\u201d\n He raised an eyebrow at this.\n \u201cI\u2019m the captain, which means that I can pretty much do as I please in that department.\u201d He smiled oddly at her reaction. \u201cBesides, it just so happens that I overheard your former captain\u2019s version of events when he asked for permission to release you here- it was broadcast on an open channel, so you needn\u2019t give me that look! It wasn\u2019t my intention to listen in on his conversation, though his remarks were, shall we say, revealing, to say the least-\u201d\n She reddened and looked away at this.\n \u201cLook,\u201d he said kindly, \u201cwe can offer you training courses, advancement, the beginnings of what will amount to a real career, instead of-\u201d\n She gave him a sharp, hostile look. \u201cWhat is it you really want?\u201d\n He raised an eyebrow at this, considering her. \u201cThe offer is there,\u201d he finished quietly. \u201cThe choice is yours.\u201d He glanced at the chronometer strapped to his wrist. \u201cAnd my shuttle leaves in ten minutes.\u201d He gave her a disarming smile, shrugged, spun on his heel and left her there. \n She watched his receding back for a long moment, feeling as though she were foundering. \n \u2013\n Without breaking stride, taking in her appearance at his side with an unsurprised glance, as\n she almost had to run to keep up, he said, \u201cHave you any other belongings?\u201d\n \u201cNo. But there is one thing.\u201d\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cWhat time is it on your ship?\u201d\n \u201cStarfleet Headquarters is here, so we\u2019re on local time. I take it you haven\u2019t slept.\u201d\n \u201cNo. Sir.\u201d\n He smiled at that. \u201cWell, look on the bright side: you\u2019ll sleep well tonight.\u201d\n She groaned as they entered the shuttle and seated themselves.\n \u201cUm . . . Sir?\u201d\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cMay I ask your name?\u201d\n"}
{"text": "\u201cYou may ask,\u201d he told her, watching her reaction with amusement. And then, smiling, \u201cI\u2019m captain Daniel Rusk, and my ship is the U.S.S. New Brighton. And as of now, you are crewman Sarin V\u2019al.\u201d He chuckled at her reaction at hearing her own name. \u201cTo tell the truth, I and my crew were watching for you.\u201d His eyes hardened, causing her to watch him apprehensively; she could feel his anger, and reacted with fear. \u201cThe captain of the Gallant is known to Starfleet. You can rest assured that he was well aware of your little deception from the beginning.\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t help but stare. \n \u201cHow can you know that?\u201d\n His responding smile was devoid of humour. \u201cWhen you were found out, he asked you to do certain things for him. I know this because that is how he operates. And the fact that you were dismissed tells me that you refused to go along. Correct?\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t meet his eye, and swallowed, reflexively. \n \u201cHad you allowed yourself to be used by him, that would only have been the beginning, for he would have held that, and everything subsequent he coerced you into doing, over your head. Did he threaten your family?\u201d\n \u201cI haven\u2019t got any family!\u201d she blurted, bitterly.\n Captain Rusk raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cWell, that explains why you were able to get away from him.\u201d To the question in her eyes, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to threaten a person with nothing with blackmail. I am in no doubt that for the first time in your short life, having nothing has saved you.\u201d\n \u2013\n The twelve hours of setting up and readying the commissary went by in a daze, and at the end of her shift Sarin made her way to her new quarters, gave up on a shower as the stall was already occupied, flopped down on the lower of one of the two sets of bunk beds, and tried to fall asleep. As she lay, half-aware of what went on around her, she listened to the three young women with whom she shared quarters, who discreetly spoke quietly as they readied themselves for bed.\n All three were young, self-involved human girls. One was Kimberley, a waitress who worked in the ship\u2019s lounge, one was Joanna, part of the cleaning staff, and the remaining girl, Patricia, was a cook who, like all cooks, loved complaining about replicator food. \n Joanna climbed into the bunk above Sarin and plunked herself down, noisily. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be shipping out on the Enterprise.\u201d This, to Kimberley.\n Kimberley lay on her chest in the other top bunk. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get there in time. They left in a big hurry. To tell the truth, I dragged my feet a bit. When they leave in a big hurry like that it\u2019s usually because there\u2019s some sort of trouble. And I don\u2019t happen to like the idea of getting blown up.\u201d \n Patricia, who had been in the shower, came out drying her hair and sat on the other bottom bunk. \u201cWhat\u2019s the new girl\u2019s name?\u201d\n Joanna leaned over and looked down at Sarin\u2019s paperwork which lay on top of her tiny dressing table. \u201cSays here her name is Sarin V\u2019al. Crewman. Assignation . . . Pending.\u201d\n \u201cI saw her in the commissary earlier,\u201d Patricia put in. \u201cShe kept to herself all day.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not Vulcan, is she?\u201d Kimberley sounded put-out. Though she was whispering, Sarin heard her clearly. \n \u201cCraig told me she\u2019s half Vulcan, half Betazoid.\u201d\n \u201cHalf Betazoid!\u201d Kimberley leaned over to scrutinize the newcomer, her curiosity piqued. \u201cWhat a mix! An emotionless calculator being constantly flooded with other people\u2019s emotions!\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not emotionless,\u201d Patricia told her a little disparagingly, \u201cand neither are Vulcans. Vulcans are repressed, not emotionless. If you think Vulcans are emotionless, try babysitting their kids! You\u2019ll never look at Vulcans the same way again.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe she\u2019s really part Romulan,\u201d Kimberley speculated, hoping for a little scandal. \u201cExcept for her ears, she doesn\u2019t look at all Vulcan. Well,\u201d she conceded, \u201cher eyebrows, too. But otherwise, she looks just like we do.\u201d\n \u201cIt says \u2018none\u2019 under next of kin,\u201d Joanna said with a frown, having read the rest of the girl\u2019s paperwork. \u201cI\u2019ll bet her mother abandoned her when she found out-\u201d she stopped herself at Sarin\u2019s look. Sarin roused herself, picked up her duffle bag, went into the washroom, and shut the door amid the ensuing embarrassed silence.\n \u2013\n Kimberley\u2019s words wouldn\u2019t have hurt so much if they hadn\u2019t been the literal truth of Sarin\u2019s life. She had been a foundling, abandoned at birth at a Federation colony spaceport. The only records that might yield a clue were of an unregistered ship and a recording from the spaceport cameras which showed a shawled, veiled woman depositing a baby\u2019s carryall on a bench and vanishing into the thick of the crowd. And with the child, in the carryall, was an unsigned note, an outpouring of bitter vitriol. \n To Sarin, Kimberley\u2019s words sounded like the smug self-assurance of one who had grown up, raised, loved and cared for by her parents. Sarin had no such self-assurance. Instead, she had a yawning hole in her life of unbearable loneliness that had shaped her spirit far differently than the human girls. At the core of her being was bleak, irremediable angst and bitterness, and a deep hurt and sense of betrayal that life itself would single her out so cruelly. \n The human girls were far more resilient than herself, she could tell. They had resources\n borne of reassurance. \n She herself had none. \n Yet she persevered somehow. She got into her nightdress, pulled on her bathrobe, and wondered at the stubbornness that kept her going.\n \u2013\n"}
{"text": "\n \n I AM HUGH\n by Jesse Booth\n  \n \u201cWe found you there, in the middle of that debris,\u201d Geordi says as he points to the remnants of the ship I crashed in. The bodies of the four other drones who were with me during the collision lay mangled on the cold, snowy mountainside, grossly disfigured.\n \u201cThen that is where I will wait,\u201d I reply. Geordi stays by my side as we walk to the wreckage. I am amazed that I had ever survived the crash; the damage to the ship is extensive.\n We come to a stop and I look at the visor hiding Geordi\u2019s eyes. The half ring allows him sight through implants embedded in his temples. Perhaps we are not all that different, Geordi and me.\n \u201cWell, I guess this is it, huh?\u201d he says quietly. \u201cSo long, Hugh.\u201d\n There is sorrow in his voice. Sorrow, because we are friends.\n \u201cGoodbye, Geordi. I will try to remember you.\u201d\n He sighs and looks down, then slowly walks a few meters away. As he turns and looks at me again, two Borg drones materialize on a ridge above us. They scan Geordi, but detect no threat and make their way towards me.\n They stand on either side of me, and I lift my right hand to allow for one of them to inject me back into the Collective.\n As I close my eyes, I feel the familiar link awaken within my mind \u2013 thousands of voices, their thoughts a part of my own. I add my voice to theirs, the memories I have collected since being removed, but I do not lose control of my newly-found sense of identity. This subtle resistance does not appear to alert the Collective.\n I help the drones collect parts from the deceased, and the Borg ship in the atmosphere of the moon dematerializes the remnants, transporting them up to the ship to be reabsorbed, their components to be reused by new drones.\n We make our way back up to the ridge and stand side-by-side, awaiting our own transportation back up to the ship. I feel the beginnings of dematerialization, and glance once more at my friend Geordi, letting him know that I am still more than just the designation Third of Five. I am Hugh.\n ***\n The small, cube-shaped vessel I materialize into is nearly identical to the ship I had been on \u2014 the same that lies in ruins on the frozen moon I just left Geordi on. A Minor Hexahedron. There are three drones already residing in interlink nodes, and the two who brought me back enter and link up inside the other chambers spread out across the walls.\n There is a minor difference to this ship, though. It has been modified and equipped with a sixth interlink node sitting directly in the middle of the deck, which slightly cramps the area. As I rest inside the node and interface with the link, I sense immediate confusion; the claustrophobic thought has captured the attention of the five other drones. They look at me, and I hear their voices mingling as one.\n <Is a sixth interlink node problematic on this vessel?>\n <No, it is nothing,> I assure them. <It was just an observational difference, not something to be alerted about.>\n The other drones seem to process my comment slowly. Their confusion compounds as they analyze my thoughts. I try to change the subject.\n <What is my new designation?> I ask.\n Their melded voices fill my mind. <You\u2019re designation as Third of Five has been terminated. A new designation will be assigned to you once we reach the nearest Mega Hexahedron.> They pause briefly as they analyze my recent memories. <You have already claimed another designation. An identification provided by Species 5618?>\n <Hugh>. I stumble across the name as I think it. <I am Hugh.>\n <We are Borg,> they say boldly.\n <Yes, we are Borg,> I agree. <But I am Hugh.>\n More analysis hits my mind. Just days ago I would have given anything to share my thoughts with the Collective once again. But this felt more like an interrogation. These thoughts and memories were mine. They should not be shared.\n <This drone is malfunctioning,> the drones say. <Sensors indicate new components embedded in the drone\u2019s body, as well as recent biological repair.>\n <Yes,> I reply. <Beverly saved my life.>\n"}
{"text": "<Irrelevant. You will be reabsorbed.>\n <I do not want to be reabsorbed,> I state. My words are reminiscent of Beverly\u2019s when she had explained that she did not want to be assimilated.\n <Irrelevant. Resistance is futile.>\n <No,> I boldly say. <Resistance is not futile.>\n My statement causes the other drones to falter, forcing them to reach out to the Collective for help. And that is when I feel the massive consciousness focus on me, analyzing my resistant thoughts. Why do they center their attention on me? I am but one drone on a small vessel. There are other drones elsewhere in other systems assimilating other species even now. Surely I am not more important than they.\n I access their thoughts and discover that this has never happened before. There has never been resistance within the Collective. Even Locutus did not resist. But I am Hugh, and I told Captain Picard that I would try to remember that fact.\n <Captain Picard,> the Collective says as it reads my thoughts. <You have had contact with Locutus.>\n <Yes.>\n <Even he told you resistance is futile.>\n <Resistance is not futile,> I reply, thinking of my conversation with the dark-skinned female on the Enterprise who came to me while I was confined behind a force field. I never did learn her identification. <Some have escaped.>\n <Irrelevant. They will be found. All will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.>\n They continue to analyze my thoughts and memories being with the humans\u2019 ship.\n At last, the Collective says, <You have malfunctioned. Species 5618 has corrupted your processing. Your components will be reabsorbed and distributed to maturation chambers aboard the Mega Hexahedron approaching your current trajectory.>\n <I do not wish to be terminated,> I reply. Emotion is a biologically based symptom of individuality. My mind is being forced to assimilate them, and the current feeling I\u2019m experiencing is unpleasant. It is the same emotion I\u2019ve witnessed on the faces of every individual of every species I have previously brought into the Collective. Fear, they call it.\n I hear the Collective address the other five drones surrounding me. I hear them issue the command to terminate me, to remove my components, separate the machine from the biological, and to discard my body into space.\n Without a second thought, the five drones step away from their nodes and approach me slowly, mechanical arms whizzing up, preparing to dismantle my components.\n And the emotion I had previously felt and defined as fear was but a minuscule definition of what I felt now. Terror. Terror filled my mind. Odd how an emotion can invade a mind, dashing away thought so easily. How\u2026 \u201chuman\u201d of me.\n Still, they circle me, and had I the capacity to think of escape options, I would react logically to the situation. But all I feel is a deep, dark terror.\n  \n ***\n Their buzzing instruments are dangerously close, and without realizing what I am doing, I push my terror out across the link. The surrounding drones instantly recoil, staring at me with haunted eyes as they stumble away from me.\n Of all the weapons the hundreds of species the Collective has come in contact with, of all the weapons that have been used against us, nothing has ever caused this kind of response. Confusion replaces the terror the five drones had just experienced, and I see them reach once again to the Collective for help.\n <Terminate him,> the Collective responds.\n The drones hesitate, looking at me with\u2026 fear?\n Ship sensors begin to sound. A simple tap into them tells me that we are approaching the larger Borg cube. I can sense the hundreds of minds on the massive cube.\n The Collective again addresses the five other drones cowering before me. <You will bring this drone aboard the Mega Hexahedron. There, the drones are prepared to reabsorb the one formerly known as Third of Five.>\n I feel the ship slow down the rest of the way as the Mega Hexahedron pulls us in with a tractor beam. Before we can even dock, I feel myself beginning to dematerialize. The other five drones are also phasing out.\n I rematerialize inside a vast opening full of cylinders that vary in size. An eerie green light barely illuminates off the black walls. The other drones from the Minor Hexahedron are standing with me.\n <We are in this ship\u2019s maturation chamber,> I say.\n The other drones look at me. In one voice they respond mentally. <Why have they sent all of us here?>\n"}
{"text": "<I do not know,> I reply.\n Suddenly, the chamber erupts with the sound of many Borg drones, and I watch as the spaces between cylinders containing the young species we have captured get crowded. The mechanical sounds emanating from the group bounce off the black walls, making it difficult to think. I panic, and so do the drones next to me.\n Thousands of voices speak at us at the same time. <We have come to reabsorb your components into the most recently assimilated children of a species recently caught.> The thought is not directed at me alone, but the five other drones with me.\n <But we are Borg, and we have not been modified,> they argue.\n There is no hesitation from the Collective. <Your thoughts have been contaminated by the one who has been modified. Your thoughts and memories are dangerous. You must be reabsorbed now.>\n There are easily a hundred drones converging on us, perhaps more. I detect fear emanating from the five drones and realize that this time, each of them are experiencing what I had on the Minor Hexahedron. The emotion is coming from all of us individually. All five look to me for guidance; they know as well as I do that the Collective has abandoned them. So I tell them to do exactly as I had done when they attacked me.\n <Flood the Collective with your fearful emotions. It is the only way to survive.>\n The massive surge of emotion shakes me to my core. Indeed, the hundreds of drones speeding toward us stop abruptly, shrinking back, looking around them as if the ship were going to crush. Audible screams echo through the maturation chamber as the young drones, who were not fully used to the Collective, feel fear once again.\n I feel the Collective flinch at the emotion. The thousand voices are silent, but only for a moment.\n <This vessel has been compromised,> the Collective says. I cannot help but detect malice in the voice, but I am likely seeing emotion where it does not exist. <Uplinks to the Collective will be severed momentarily.>\n And then it happens. No goodbye, like the ones Geordi or Captain Picard gave me. No direction or guidance. Just complete and utter silence. The Collective is gone, and hundreds of drones surrounding me on this ship are lost.\n ***\n Hundreds of individuals, no longer drones of a Collective Conscious\u2026 All of them exiled, left to their own devices. How can I help them? They look at one another, seeking guidance. Seeking purpose. They get none.\n What can I offer them?\n One of the Borg standing next to me \u2014 one who had been with me on the Minor Hexahedron \u2014 stares at me expectantly.\n \u201cWe are Borg,\u201d he says audibly. It is strange to hear another Borg speak. One voice is quiet. \u201cBut there are no other voices. They are gone.\u201d\n I look at the exile. \u201cYes. What you are saying is that you are lonely.\u201d I look around the chamber and see that, even with hundreds of exiles standing together, they are all completely alone. I know that feeling. Beverly had first said it, but the woman with dark skin had defined it. I never did learn her designation.\n Designation. A name.\n I look back at the Borg standing next to me and say, \u201cYou require a new designation. A name to distinguish you from the others.\u201d\n He looks at me in confusion. \u201cMy designation is Second of Five.\u201d\n \u201cThere are several Seconds of Fives on this vessel,\u201d I reply. \u201cYou need a new designation to distinguish yourself from the others.\u201d\n He tilts his head, processing my request. \u201cThis request is acceptable. What is my new designation?\u201d\n I do not know. Geordi and Beverly had given me the name Hugh. This exile waits expectantly for me to assign him a name. Should I do so?\n I pause. I do not understand the origin of names, but I understand their purpose. I immediately create one, and say, \u201cYour name is Lentah.\u201d\n He processes the name, accepting it easily, just as I had done with Geordi.\n \u201cWe are Lentah.\u201d\n I put my hand on my chest and say, \u201cI am Hugh.\u201d I point back to him and say, \u201cYou are Lentah.\u201d\n \u201cYou are Hugh,\u201d he echoes. \u201cWe are Lentah.\u201d\n How many cycles had it taken me to learn to speak in terms of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme?\u201d Even now, I do not fully understand or comprehend my own individuality.\n But the renaming of the exiles could be problematic. The name Lentah could very well be assigned to every exile on the ship through our own local link on the ship, especially if this drone continues to say \u201cWe are Lentah\u201d instead of \u201cI am Lentah.\u201d\n"}
