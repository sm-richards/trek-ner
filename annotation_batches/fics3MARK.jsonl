They had heads like worms and many, many tendrils like threads that fanned out through her body. \n “They seem to be hardwired into her nervous system,” the Doctor went on, “sending and receiving signals from her central nervous system. They’re supplementing natural organ functions and regulating hormone levels, stimulating the growth of some cells and inhibiting others. They also seem to be modifying her DNA.”\n Chakotay studied the diagram and the accompanying readings, a sense of disgust and trepidation rising up in him. “This resembles Borg technology. Is there any evidence of nanoprobes at work here?” The desiccated corpse of a Borg drone he’d stumbled upon on an away mission last week was still fresh in his mind. The specter of Borg cubes lurking just outside of sensor range in the murky depths of the Nekrid Expanse had haunted him ever since.\n “Certainly not any of Borg design,” said the Doctor, alleviating his fears but not quashing them completely. “My tests are ongoing, though.”\n Chakotay studied the diagram closer. “What do you make of this one?” he said, pointing at the alien construct occupying the diagram’s skull.\n “That implant is the one that worries me the most,” said the Doctor. “Its processes are threaded throughout her brain. It might influence her cognition and her perceptions, bias her behavior… it could conceivably even be controlling her body. I’ll monitor her engrams for any irregularities when she wakes.”\n Chakotay was quiet for a moment, regarding his unconscious officer. He’d let her down, back on that space station. He hadn’t acted fast enough when that pod had opened. He should have destroyed the thing the moment it made a sound. He should have acted faster when the cables ensnared Ensign Kang. If only he’d been faster, sharper, quicker on his feet…\n He wouldn’t let her down now. The alien space station still had her, even if she was out of the pod. He had to find a way to stop its progress before it finished turning her into… whatever it was turning her into.\n But, he couldn’t let himself forget, he also had a duty to protect the rest of the crew. He tapped his combadge. “Chakotay to Tuvok,” he said.\n “Tuvok here, sir.”\n “Assign two security personnel to sickbay. The Doctor will brief them when they arrive.”\n “Acknowledged,” said Tuvok.\n Chakotay met the Doctor’s gaze, and the Doctor nodded his understanding.\n “Under alien control or not, our crewmember is still in there, Doctor,” said Chakotay. “I know you’ll do everything in your power to help her.”\n “Of course, sir,” said the Doctor.\n Chakotay walked out of the Doctor’s office and crossed sickbay. The doors to the corridor opened as he approached, and standing outside was Chief Vance, looking very dour. That was fast, thought Chakotay. But then he noticed that the security officer wasn’t approaching the door, but apparently dithering in the corridor. “Is there something I can help you with, Chief?” said Chakotay.\n Vance jumped to attention at the sight of his senior officer. “No, sir. I just wanted to know if I could visit the patient.”\n Chakotay felt his eyebrow rising and quickly schooled his facial expression. “You’ll have to ask the Doctor,” he said, and then he passed out into the corridor.\n  \n “…told her how you felt, before?” It was a gentle, feminine voice. Lucy was sure she recognized it.\n “Yes… well… I mean, I think she has the general idea,” said someone else. It was a man’s voice, low and brash, and the connotations of his tenor stirred a sense of attraction, balanced on a knife’s edge with a sense of discomfort.\n Owen, that was the second one.

{"id": 11, "text": "Off to Lucy’s right, something started beeping. It sounded like a sickbay biomonitor.\n “Doctor!” Kes called, and then she leaned in close to Lucy. “Ensign, are you awake?”\n Lucy opened her eyes and took in the faces around her. Owen stood on her left, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Kes sat on her right, holding Lucy’s hand. A couple other security officers stood guard by the sickbay doors. The Doctor was approaching from his office, his face a mask of concern.\n “Ensign?” said the Doctor, “How are you feeling?”\n Lucy took stock of herself for a moment. The sickbay bed she was lying on was comfortable. The sickbay blanket felt nice on her skin. “I feel alright,” she said. She propped herself up on her elbows, and as her weight shifted, she noticed something about her body was… off. She couldn’t immediately pin down what it was, though.\n The Doctor took a medical tricorder off a nearby shelf and began scanning her. Without lifting his eyes from the device, he tapped his badge and said, “Doctor to the Bridge.”\n “Janeway here, Doctor,” came the captain’s voice. “What’s your status?”\n “Ensign Kang is awake, sir.”\n “Acknowledged, Doctor. Thank you.”\n The Doctor stopped scanning and looked back at his patient.\n “Are you in any pain?” he said.\n Lucy shook her head. “No, I’m good.”\n The Doctor’s concerned expression didn’t waver. “Do you know where you are right now, Ensign?”\n Lucy chuckled a little at the question. “Sickbay. Voyager. The Delta Quadrant.”\n The Doctor bit his lip for a moment and said, “Do you know why you’re in sickbay, Ensign Kang?”\n “Well…” said Lucy, and she glanced around at the others gathered around her bed. The intensity with which the Doctor, Kes and Owen were all looking at her was starting to make her a little bit uncomfortable. The security officers at the door to sickbay were troubling, as well.\n She returned her attention to the Doctor. “I mean after what happened on the space station…” she cast a meaningful glance at Owen. It had been an intense ordeal, and Owen, at least, would know a bit about what she’d been through. “It’s hardly a surprise.”\n The Doctor nodded. He still looked worried. Lucy wondered why. She was fine, now. She felt fine. Did he know something she didn’t?\n The Doctor turned to Owen. “Mr. Vance, I’m sorry, but could you excuse us, please?”\n Owen nodded. “Of course, Doctor,” he said. “I’m glad you’re alright,” he told Lucy.\n She saw the sincerity in his eyes, and it surprised her. She wondered if she hadn’t been too hard on him before. It was obvious she was attracted to the security officer, so why did she have to make things complicated?\n Owen turned and headed towards the doors. Lucy called, “Hey Owen.” He paused and looked back at her. Lucy smiled warmly at him. “Thanks for visiting me,” she said.\n Owen’s eyes grew a little wider. He flashed an uncertain smile and nodded, then left the sickbay.\n Lucy returned her attention to the Doctor, who was studying her face like a bug under a magnifying glass.\n “Ensign, are you aware that your skin pigmentation is changing?” he said.\n “Huh?” said Lucy. Her hand rose to her cheek. “You mean I’m blushing?”\n The Doctor shook his head. “No, that’s not what I mean.”\n Lucy looked from the Doctor to Kes, who was squinting at Lucy’s face now, too. “Your lips are reddening,” she said.\n “Really?” said Lucy. Her fingers moved to her lips. “That’s weird…”\n Kes stood and crossed the sickbay, apparently looking for something.

{"id": 12, "text": "“Ensign Kang, are you aware of any… out of the ordinary sensations? Any pain or discomfort, anywhere in your body?”\n Lucy shifted her hips and rolled her shoulders, gauging her senses. “No, Doctor. I told you, I’m fine.”\n “You’re not experiencing any nausea? No trembling? No sense of weakness? No fear or anxiety?”\n Lucy shook her head. “Not really…”\n The Doctor sighed. “Don’t you think that’s odd, considering what you’ve just been through?”\n Lucy shrugged. “I mean… I’m alive. That’s what matters, right?”\n The Doctor just shook his head. “Do you have any sense of what was done to you on that station?”\n Lucy considered. It was certainly not something pleasant to contemplate, but for the Doctor’s sake, she tried.\n “Well, at first, I was in a lot of pain, and I was terrified. I thought I was going to die, and what a horrible way it would have been to go.”\n Lucy felt an involuntary shudder, but it seemed out of place to her. The recollection didn’t actually bother her all that much.\n “Then… all of a sudden, the pain stopped. I was literally being stabbed all over my body and twisted around by all these strong cords, and yet, somehow, it didn’t hurt anymore. Maybe the pod used a numbing agent? And then, suddenly, I wasn’t afraid anymore. I still thought I was dying. I guess maybe I was in shock? Or I’d just accepted it as inevitable? But I wasn’t scared at all, just… inexpressibly sad. I thought I’d never get home again.”\n It was hard to convey the experience to the Doctor. It was hard to even remember what it had felt like, to be that sad. She couldn’t really find the feeling inside her anymore.\n “Then, the sadness was gone too. That was the weirdest part. Like, I felt all these slimy tubes sticking into my body, and I could feel it under my skin. I could even feel it in my head. Like something out the worst, most disgusting, horrific nightmare. And all I could gin up in reaction was this big sense of, ‘Wow, this should really be bothering me a lot more than it is.’ But I guess I was just exhausted by that point. By the time the pod let me go, I was beyond ready to just pass out.”\n Lucy’s attention returned to her current surroundings. The Doctor looked at her with compassionate eyes. Kes stood in front of her bed, clutching a hand mirror against her chest. Her face was ashen, and tears were welling up in her wide eyes. She blinked several times to clear her eyes, and then she stepped forward and handed Lucy the mirror. “Here,” she said. “I thought you’d want to see what we were talking about.” The young Ocampan hardly got the words out before she turned away. She wiped her eyes with her hands as she walked quickly to the Doctor’s office, letting the doors close behind her.\n Lucy didn’t know what to make of that reaction. She supposed the story must have been pretty upsetting to hear.\n “Are you upset, that that happened to you?” said the Doctor.\n She shook her head. “It’s over, now.”\n “Are you worried about what the lasting effects might be?”\n Lucy shrugged. “A little, maybe.”\n “And you aren’t in any pain.”\n “I told you, no. Why do you keep asking that?”\n The Doctor took a deep breath. “Ensign Kang… Lucy… currently, inside of your body, there are fifteen biosynthetic constructs of alien design, with countless threads branching out through all of your major organs. They’re already fully integrated with your biology. I can’t remove them. And they’re… changing you.”\n “Wow, that’s… fascinating!” said Lucy. “Are they primarily organic, or do they incorporate organic tissues in an inorganic framework?”\n The Doctor’s eyebrows shot up. “I just told you your body was full of alien implants, Ensign. That isn’t the sort of reaction I was expecting.”\n Lucy reflected for a moment. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. You said they’re in every organ… that must include my brain. Do you suppose they’re changing my behavior, too?”\n The Doctor nodded. “I think that’s a safe deduction, yes,” he said.\n “Then, you must be worried that I could pose a threat to the ship,” she said. She glanced at the security officers by the doors, Crewman Jeffery Thorold and Crewman Megan Steiner. Jeffery was watching her out of the corner of his eye. When he saw her looking at him, his attention returned directly ahead.\n “Keep up the good work, Jeff, Megan,” said Lucy. “Sorry I’ve got you stuck on guard duty. I know it can be pretty dull.”\n “Ensign, would you please focus?” said the Doctor.\n Lucy was surprised at his irritation, though she supposed she shouldn’t have been.

{"id": 16, "text": "CHAPTER 5\n “Here we go again,” said Tom. He was seated on Chakotay’s left, in the pilot seat of the shuttlecraft. Tuvok, Torres, and Kim filled out the rest of the party. \n Ahead of the shuttle, the violet eye of the wormhole loomed large. Chakotay found that the experience of having passed through the aperture twice already wasn’t helping his stomach. His guts knew exactly what to expect, and it prepared for the ride by thrashing around inside of him well in advance.\n Chakotay cast a quick glance over his shoulder at the other three occupants of the shuttlecraft. Ensign Kim in the back looked about as green as Chakotay felt. Tuvok looked positively bored, as usual for the Vulcan. Torres was eyeing the wormhole with unwary fascination. She was obviously not prepared for the rough road that lay ahead.\n Chakotay caught her eye and flashed her an enigmatic smile that she clearly couldn’t interpret, and then they passed into the wormhole.\n A slight shimmy rattled through the spaceframe of the shuttlecraft, and then they were out on the other side. That was it. No sudden jolt to the inertial dampeners, and no abrupt torque on the shuttle’s nose cone, either.\n “What, that was it?” said Torres. “I was expecting…” She shrugged.\n Chakotay gave Lieutenant Paris a questioning look.\n “Don’t look at me, sir,” said Tom, “I only wish I could take the credit.”\n Ensign Kim consulted his console. “Variances inside of the wormhole were down in the two millicochrane range,” he said. “Telemetry suggests the wormhole spontaneously stabilized in the last seconds before we made the passage.”\n “And now, the wormhole is returning to its previous degree of instability,” Tuvok reported, consulting his own console. “It would appear that some external force acted momentarily to ensure our safe passage.”\n As Chakotay considered that bit of information, Ensign Kim ran more scans of the space surrounding the abandoned station. Lieutenant Torres tore her attention from the stunning view outside with an effort and turned her attention to her own console.\n “The power output of the station is roughly twice what it was the last time we were here, Commander,” said Ensign Kim.\n “At least,” Torres added. “And the power seems more stable and distributed around the station than what the telemetry from your last mission recorded.”\n “I guess the station’s been doing some straightening up since our last visit,” said Chakotay. He was just considering hailing the station again when his communications board lit up. \n A tone sounded from Ensign Kim’s ops console, and he announced, “Commander, we’re being hailed.”\n “I see that, Ensign,” said Chakotay, and he opened a channel with the press of a button.\n Lieutenant Paris said, “Commander, are you sure that’s such a good idea?” but it was already done.\n Chakotay just regarded Tom with a cocked eyebrow and a slight shrug.\n “Welcome, returning customers!” The voice of the station resembled the voice from the last visit in inflection and tone only. Where before it had been grating and artificial, it now sounded as clear and natural as organic speech.\n It went on, “You’ve reached the Delurididug Deep Space Travel Network and Trade Hub. Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Travel Network is currently unavailable. However, the Trade Hub is open for business! We are currently transmitting your instructions for docking.”\n Chakotay’s console received a packet of data from the station, which the computer was able to compile into a simple, graphically represented set of docking instructions. The voice from the station continued talking without pause.\n “Please be patient while those ships in queue ahead of yours finish their approaches and departures. Visitors will be cleared to dock in the same order that they arrived through the gateways.”\n Chakotay glanced around the empty space around the station and exchanged a look with Lieutenant Paris. Tom shook his head. No one else was out there.\n The automated voice went on, “All forms of faster-than-light travel and remote matter transference are prohibited inside of Hub Space. Any unwarranted act of violence or aggression against the Hub, the Network, the proprietors of the Hub, or other visitors to the Hub or Network is also prohibited. All contracts joined in good faith within the confines of Hub Space are binding. The Hub and its licensed proprietors reserve the right to withhold service from any customer for any reason. The Hub and the Network are committed to upholding the laws of the Delurididug Trade Federation, as well as the laws specific to the nationalities of each customer, subject to the limits of Trade Federation Law. The Delurididug Trade Hub is empowered by the Delurididug Trade Federation to enforce all binding contracts within the limits of Trade Federation law. Violations of binding contracts are subject to summary arbitration, and may result in confiscation of trade goods or formally recognized legal tender, expulsion from Hub Space, arrest pending trial in a Trade Federation Tribunal, or any combination of the above, subject to the judgment of the administration of the Trade Hub and within the limits of Trade Federation Law.\n “For more on the rules, regulations, and policies governing the Trade Hub Station and its surrounding space, please refer to the terms of service that are being transmitted now.” Chakotay studied his console as the computer received another data packet and compiled it into an encyclopedia-sized volume of alien legalese.\n “Tuvok, I’m sending you their rulebook. See if there’s anything in the rules about restricted areas. Maybe we can narrow down the possible locations of the computer core or their power generators, based on where they don’t want us to go. And while you’re at it, see if there’s a procedure in place for filing complaints.”\n “Aye, sir,” said Tuvok.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[36, 39, "PER"], [58, 68, "PER"], [114, 119, "PER"], [121, 127, "PER"], [133, 136, "PER"], [240, 248, "PER"], [474, 482, "PER"], [571, 581, "PER"], [619, 627, "PER"], [634, 639, "PER"], [682, 688, "SPEC"], [690, 696, "PER"], [813, 821, "PER"], [1199, 1205, "PER"], [1241, 1249, "PER"], [1255, 1271, "PER"], [1323, 1326, "PER"], [1368, 1378, "PER"], [1672, 1677, "PER"], [1809, 1817, "PER"], [1854, 1865, "PER"], [1928, 1945, "PER"], [2147, 2156, "PER"], [2164, 2174, "PER"], [2189, 2195, "PER"], [2414, 2422, "PER"], [2534, 2546, "PER"], [2579, 2588, "PER"], [2625, 2631, "PER"], [2639, 2647, "PER"], [2702, 2718, "PER"], [2726, 2735, "PER"], [2802, 2810, "PER"], [2825, 2828, "PER"], [3135, 3186, "LOC"], [3233, 3247, "LOC"], [3287, 3296, "LOC"], [3382, 3392, "PER"], [3807, 3815, "PER"], [3892, 3908, "PER"], [3910, 3913, "PER"], [4082, 4091, "LOC"], [4151, 4154, "ORG"], [4160, 4167, "ORG"], [4192, 4195, "LOC"], [4222, 4225, "LOC"], [4229, 4236, "LOC"], [4315, 4324, "LOC"], [4342, 4345, "LOC"], [4451, 4454, "ORG"], [4463, 4470, "ORG"], [4514, 4542, "ORG"], [4637, 4653, "ORG"], [4663, 4684, "ORG"], [4705, 4733, "ORG"], [4788, 4804, "ORG"], [4976, 4985, "LOC"], [5013, 5038, "ORG"], [5126, 5135, "ORG"], [5161, 5177, "ORG"], [5248, 5265, "LOC"], [5363, 5371, "PER"], [5508, 5513, "PER"], [5847, 5852, "PER"]]}
{"id": 17, "text": "“Respectfully, sir,” said Paris, “Do you really think there’s someone over there that handles complaints?”\n Chakotay shrugged. “We still don’t know the capabilities of the station, especially now that it’s regained so much function. But it’s clearly highly automated, and it seems to put a lot of value in laws and contracts. We might be able to use that to learn more about what’s happening to Ensign Kang, and hopefully, how to reverse it.”\n “You’re not seriously counting on that station to respect Federation laws, are you?” said Torres. “Our Federation, that is.”\n “I’m not counting on anything, Lieutenant,” said Chakotay, “Just exploring all options.”\n Harry shook his head, but he didn’t look up from his console.\n “Something the matter, Ensign?” said Chakotay.\n “No, sir,” said Harry. “Just… I keep thinking about Neelix’s ghost story.”\n Chakotay’s reply was interrupted by the voice of the station. “Thank you for your patience. Your vessel has been cleared to dock. We are sending you an updated flight plan to guide you to your berth. Any deviation from the flight plan is grounds to revoke your boarding privileges and move your vessel to the back of the queue. Repeated or flagrant violations may lead to expulsion from Hub Space.\n “If you prefer, you may turn over guidance to the Trade Hub guidance system, and we will guide your vessel into its berth.”\n “Fat chance,” Tom remarked.\n Chakotay’s console received the flight plan, and he sent it over to Tom. “Just stick to the flight plan, Tom. I’d hate to have to wait in that line again,” he deadpanned.\n Tom gave Chakotay a quizzical glance, and Chakotay favored him with a slight smile. \n With a smirk, Tom turned his attention back to his console and punched a series of instructions into the shuttle’s guidance system. “Aye, sir. Course laid in and plotted.”\n “Take us in,” said Chakotay.\n  \n \n  \n They entered the station through the same port as on their previous visit. Inside the bay, conditions had changed markedly. The atmosphere and gravity were the same, but the illumination had increased significantly, owing to an array of free-floating orbs of yellow-white light that hovered over the shuttle bay like little Suns, giving the space an inviting, almost Earth-like quality.\n Tom set the shuttle down exactly where the flight plan indicated and ran quickly through his power-down checklist while the rest of the crew gave their reports on the station. When they were ready, Tuvok opened the shuttle door.\n And he froze in the doorway.\n His expression betrayed no surprise or confusion, so it took a moment for Chakotay to understand why the security chief had paused in place. Chakotay looked out through the door and found a man standing in the docking bay at the bottom of the shuttle’s shallow ramp, hands spread wide in greeting.\n He looked human, with dusky but not dark features, slightly wavy, short, dark brown hair, the barest hint of points to his ears, the slightest upward angle of his eyebrows, and deep wrinkles in the center of his forehead that might have been the beginning of a cranial ridge. He had a wide smile, and his teeth were perfectly even and dazzlingly white. And, he wore a loose-fitting, flowing three-piece outfit woven from dark gray and deep burgundy fabrics, with curious accents of hardened leather on the shoulders and forearms, as if he were trying to split the difference between a traditional Terran suit, a Vulcan dignitary robe, and ceremonial Klingon armor.\n Tuvok overcame his momentary surprise and brought his tricorder to bear on the stranger.\n “Welcome to the Delurididug Trade Hub,” said the stranger. “I’m your host and point of contact for all of your questions and concerns regarding the station. You can call me Hux.”\n “It’s a projection, sir,” said Tuvok.\n Hux’s smile grew even wider. “Well spotted, Lieutenant!” he said. “When your party is all prepared, I can lead you to any of the publicly available levels of the station.” Turning to Chakotay, he said, “Tell me, how long can we expect to have the pleasure of your company, Commander…”\n “Chakotay,” said Chakotay. He was quietly impressed that the projection was apparently able to read and interpret his provisional rank insignia. Clearly, the station had gathered quite a bit of information on its deep dive through the shuttle’s computer core. He wondered if it didn’t already know each of their names, and was only letting him introduce himself as a matter of politeness.\n Remembering the projection had asked him a question, Chakotay added, “I’m not sure. It will depend on… how we might be able to help each other.”\n Hux nodded. “I look forward to discussing that with you. For now, let’s adjourn to a reception area, shall we?”\n Chakotay glanced back at his away team and verified that they were all ready to proceed.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[26, 31, "PER"], [108, 116, "PER"], [395, 406, "PER"], [502, 512, "GPE"], [547, 557, "GPE"], [601, 611, "PER"], [534, 540, "PER"], [619, 627, "PER"], [660, 665, "PER"], [746, 752, "PER"], [760, 768, "PER"], [787, 792, "PER"], [823, 831, "PER"], [847, 857, "PER"], [1234, 1243, "LOC"], [1296, 1305, "ORG"], [1400, 1410, "PER"], [1468, 1471, "PER"], [1505, 1508, "PER"], [1572, 1575, "PER"], [1581, 1589, "PER"], [1614, 1622, "PER"], [1672, 1675, "PER"], [1850, 1858, "PER"], [2236, 2241, "LOC"], [2257, 2260, "PER"], [2455, 2460, "PER"], [2591, 2599, "PER"], [2622, 2636, "PER"], [2658, 2666, "PER"], [2727, 2738, "LOC"], [2826, 2831, "SPEC"], [3413, 3419, "LOC"], [3428, 3434, "SPEC"], [3466, 3473, "SPEC"], [3482, 3487, "PER"], [3588, 3609, "LOC"], [3745, 3748, "PER"], [3783, 3788, "PER"], [3791, 3796, "PER"], [3835, 3845, "PER"], [3974, 3982, "PER"], [4064, 4073, "PER"], [4078, 4086, "PER"], [4094, 4102, "PER"], [4520, 4528, "PER"], [4613, 4616, "PER"], [4726, 4734, "PER"]]}
{"id": 18, "text": "“Lead the way,” he said.\n Hux led the away team towards the doors at the edge of the docking bay. Chakotay was gratified to see that his officers instinctively arrayed themselves in a rough pentagon, tricorders out and scanning their surroundings, phasers holstered but charged. No one needed to be reminded that they were still boarding a dangerous and unpredictable relic of an ancient and powerful civilization, regardless of the warm welcome they’d received thus far.\n When they reached the doorway, Hux stopped and addressed the party.\n “Now, those of you who have visited the Hub in the past are no doubt familiar with the scanner up ahead. For the rest of you, there’s no cause for alarm. The scanner is completely harmless. It provides the Trade Hub with a set of individualized biometrics in order to tailor our services for each individual. It’s also a security feature. The scanner will catalog your sidearms and any other self-defense implements on your person, as well as any hazardous materials you might be carrying. \n “Now, before you start to worry, allow me to reassure you that the Trade Hub does not make a habit of confiscating instruments of self-defense. However, we do employ a wide variety of neutralizing countermeasures in the event of accidental discharges or attempts at violence between guests. Your safety is among our highest priorities. If there are any questions about that, I’d be happy to answer them.”\n The others looked to Chakotay, and Hux seemed to follow their lead.\n Chakotay supposed it was a safe bet that the station was familiar with their phasers, seeing as it seemed to know everything else about them. He supposed there was no point in playing his cards close to his chest.\n “My away team is equipped with phased nadion beam weapons, calibrated to stun an attacker with non-lethal force. The Trade Hub won’t interfere with their functioning?”\n “Ah! Phasers are a classic, tried-and-true instrument of choice for a civilized society. And with a stun setting functionality! I applaud you on your choice. Humane, non-lethal weapons are truly a distinction of an advanced culture. \n “Of course, the Trade Hub will not interfere with the operation of your weapons. However, if any of them should happen to discharge during your stay in the Trade Hub, our countermeasures will neutralize their effect. The only exception is in the highly unlikely event that a rogue actor somehow manages to circumvent station security and take aggressive actions against members of your party. In such a case, the Trade Hub will not interfere in your legally recognized right to defend yourselves. However, any collateral damage that you might incur in such an event will need to be settled before you depart.”\n Chakotay nodded his understanding. “We’re also carrying subspace transceivers and general purpose handheld scanners. These will also be allowed to operate without interference?”\n “Of course!” said Hux, “So long as your instruments aren’t used to violate Trade Hub regulations or terms of service, we will not interfere with their operation in any way. Now, are there any more questions?”\n Chakotay glanced at the other members of the away team, inviting them to speak up if they could think of anything else to ask.\n “No?” said Hux, “Excellent. Let’s proceed.”\n The projection passed through the doorway. Chakotay waved Tuvok through, and the familiar light show flashed over him as he passed. Chakotay followed after, and the others followed him through, one at a time.\n When they were all through, Hux addressed the away team. “Now then, where would you like to begin? I regret that the inoperable state of the Travel Network has left the Trade Hub with a shortage of licensed vendors, but the Trade Hub still provides innumerable automated services and unique goods of sale that I guarantee, you will not find anywhere else in the galaxy. Based on your consumer history, can I suggest we proceed to the Aug-Tech Parlor, first?”\n Chakotay exchanged nonplussed expressions Tom and B’elanna.\n “What’s that?” said Chakotay.\n “Aug-Tech? Why, it’s our line of trademarked, consumer-grade, biosynthetic augmentation technologies, of course!”\n “Is that where we went on our previous visit?” said Chakotay.\n “Why, yes. Are you interested in augmenting another member of your party? Or perhaps you’re interested in purchasing one of our Aug-Tech augments for your crew? They’re highly customizable, able to fill a vast array of functions with greater efficiency than you’ve ever dreamed possible. Whether you’re in need of soldiers, technicians, recreational specialists…” He finished with a wink, making it all-too-clear what kind of ‘recreation’ he was referring to.\n Chakotay tasted bile. With effort, he restrained his anger.\n “Now, hold on!” said Lieutenant Torres. The same outrage that Chakotay felt was clear on the half-Klingon engineer’s face. Chakotay held up his hand to forestall an imminent outburst. Torres met his eyes and nodded her understanding.\n “Explain these augments to me, please,” said Chakotay.\n “Could you specify?” said Hux, “What exactly would you like me to explain?”\n “Are your augments living, sentient beings? Do they have any rights at all, or are they just… slaves?”\n Hux seemed confused by the question for just a moment before realization dawned. “Ah. I see your confusion,” said Hux. “It seems such practices are illegal in your civilization.”\n Chakotay nodded. “Yes, they certainly are.”\n “Hm. Well then, I’m afraid we can’t sell you any augments after all. It is the policy of the Hub never to facilitate activities that are classified as unlawful in the civilizations of our guests, you see. I’m terribly sorry if that poses any inconvenience.”\n “What if we wished to secure the freedom of your augments?” said Chakotay.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[26, 29, "PER"], [85, 96, "LOC"], [98, 106, "PER"], [504, 507, "PER"], [582, 585, "LOC"], [748, 757, "ORG"], [1101, 1110, "ORG"], [1461, 1469, "PER"], [1475, 1478, "PER"], [1509, 1517, "PER"], [1841, 1850, "ORG"], [2144, 2153, "ORG"], [2284, 2293, "LOC"], [2541, 2550, "ORG"], [2739, 2747, "PER"], [2936, 2939, "PER"], [2993, 3002, "ORG"], [3128, 3136, "PER"], [3267, 3270, "PER"], [3344, 3352, "PER"], [3359, 3364, "PER"], [3433, 3441, "PER"], [3539, 3542, "PER"], [3680, 3689, "ORG"], [3735, 3744, "ORG"], [3945, 3960, "LOC"], [3971, 3979, "PER"], [4013, 4016, "PER"], [4021, 4029, "PER"], [4052, 4060, "PER"], [4230, 4238, "PER"], [4702, 4710, "PER"], [4784, 4801, "PER"], [4825, 4833, "PER"], [4861, 4868, "SPEC"], [4886, 4894, "PER"], [4947, 4953, "PER"], [5043, 5051, "PER"], [5080, 5083, "PER"], [5235, 5238, "PER"], [5349, 5352, "PER"], [5415, 5423, "PER"], [5553, 5556, "PER"], [5784, 5792, "PER"]]}

She’d studied Vulcan and Tellar languages in the Academy just to meet the core requirements, but she never really had a good head for languages. And besides, the universal translator was simply too convenient of a shortcut to even bother. She would have been hard pressed, these days, to recall even the more salient Tellarite curse words. But now, French invectives were free-flowing.\n “Whoever wrote that program can brûle en l’enfer! And what are you laughing at, Owen?”\n She whirled about on the security officer who was escorting her back to sickbay.\n Owen pinched his lips tight, trying to hide his mirth and failing. The other security officer, Crewman DeVries, subtly distanced himself from Owen, leaving him to bear the brunt of Lucy’s wrath.\n “Is it funny to you, that the Doctor is going to judge my fitness as a Starfleet officer on the outcome of a badly written holodeck melodrama?”\n After a promising start, the atmospheric Roma carnival setting had dissolved into chaos. A series of contrived plot twists revealed that half the food vendors were actually terrorists. They locked down the fairgrounds and rounded up as many hostages as they could get their hands on. Of course, the task of rescuing everyone fell almost immediately on Lucy. There was never a satisfactory reason given for this. She was simply a stranger in their midst that everyone decided to turn to for leadership. \n By this point, Lucy strongly suspected that someone had taken a beautifully crafted holodeck worldspace and overwritten it with the plot of a haphazard, clichéd action/adventure novel.\n Owen shook his head. “No. You’re right. The Doctor’s program was… merde.” He struggled and failed to hold in a smile.\n “Then what’s so funny?” Lucy shouted.\n “Nothing,” said Owen. “It’s just… nice to see you getting angry.”\n “What?” said Lucy. She shook her head in bewilderment. “Why?”\n “Just…” Owen cast a glance at Bobby DeVries, and lowered his voice to near-inaudibility. “Since what happened… You haven’t once gotten upset about anything.”\n Lucy blinked. “So what?”\n “So it was a really upsetting thing that happened!” he said. “I just… I don’t know if you’re in denial about it or what, but…”\n DeVries cleared his throat, bringing Owen up short.\n “Sorry,” said Owen, “I’m not supposed to talk about that. Let’s just get back to sickbay, ok?”\n Lucy didn’t move. “I’m not in denial,” she said. “I know what was done to me. I feel it, even now. But the worst is long over. I understand why everyone has their doubts, but I wish people would listen to me when I say I’m fine!”\n Owen sighed. “Well, good. I’m glad you’re ok. But I can’t help worrying about you, Lucy.”\n She almost asked “Why,” but the look on his face drew her up short. His concerns were etched into the lines around his ice-blue eyes, and deeper emotions seemed to dwell just under the surface of his gaze.\n Suddenly, Lucy didn’t know what to say. She stared into his eyes for a long moment, looking for a clearer sign of what he was thinking.\n Bobby cleared his throat again.\n Owen cast an annoyed glance at his colleague, then looked back at Lucy. “Your eyes are changing again,” he said.\n “Oh?” said Lucy. “Now what are they doing?”\n Owen smiled. “They’re going back to normal. They’re dark brown again, and the makeup is fading, too.”\n Lucy was relieved to hear it. She glanced down at her arms and saw her porcelain pallor was returning to its natural, olive tones. “Good,” she said.\n Another beat of silence passed, and suddenly it felt awkward.\n “Well, the Doctor’s going to start wondering where we are,” said Owen.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[53, 57, "PER"], [144, 150, "SPEC"], [155, 161, "SPEC"], [179, 186, "ORG"], [447, 456, "SPEC"], [597, 601, "PER"], [677, 684, "LOC"], [687, 691, "PER"], [782, 797, "PER"], [829, 833, "PER"], [868, 874, "PER"], [913, 919, "PER"], [954, 963, "ORG"], [1380, 1384, "PER"], [1547, 1551, "PER"], [1718, 1722, "PER"], [1616, 1624, "LOC"], [1006, 1014, "LOC"], [1762, 1770, "PER"], [1861, 1865, "PER"], [1892, 1896, "PER"], [1956, 1960, "PER"], [2014, 2018, "PER"], [2036, 2049, "PER"], [2165, 2169, "PER"], [2319, 2326, "PER"], [2356, 2360, "PER"], [2386, 2390, "PER"], [2453, 2460, "LOC"], [2468, 2472, "PER"], [2699, 2703, "PER"], [2782, 2786, "PER"], [3007, 3011, "PER"], [3134, 3139, "PER"], [3167, 3171, "PER"], [3233, 3237, "PER"], [3292, 3296, "PER"], [3326, 3330, "PER"], [3429, 3433, "PER"], [3653, 3661, "PER"], [3707, 3711, "PER"]]}
{"id": 20, "text": "“Right,” said Lucy. “Let’s go.” She turned around to head towards sickbay, but at the mention of the Doctor, she remembered the bloodbath that the holonovel had become, and her anger returned in force. “But I swear, if he tries to blame me for the outcome of that terrible program…”\n “I’ll vouch for you,” said Owen. He put a comforting hand on her shoulder, and soothing warmth seemed to suffuse her body from the touch, working wonders for her temper. She was halfway tempted to put her hand over his until he began gently pushing, trying to urge her back into motion. “You did everything that could be expected from a junior science officer.”\n The way he qualified his statement rubbed Lucy the wrong way. She pushed his hand away and turned on him again. “What, you think you could have done better?” she challenged.\n Owen just pointed down the corridor towards sickbay.\n “Hmpf,” said Lucy, and she turned around and marched the rest of the way to sickbay without looking back.\n  \n \n  \n “I’m sorry, Ensign, I can’t clear you for duty yet.”\n “Why?” said Lucy, “Because I couldn’t save some of the hostages?”\n “No, that’s not it,” said the Doctor.\n They were back in the Doctor’s office, and Owen and Bobby were back to guarding the entrance to sickbay. For now, Lucy and the Doctor could converse in private.\n “What was I supposed to do,” said Lucy, “go all Michael Bernam? Maybe that would have worked in that two-bit hack holonovel, but in the real world—”\n “I said…” the Doctor tried to talk over her, but Lucy steamrolled forward.\n “Those sorts of shoot-from-the-hip heroics just start wars and get people killed! I tried to get into their heads. I tried to find their motivations so I could work out a peaceful resolution! Little did I know, they were all just cartoon villains! If you took me to the holodeck just to play a shoot-em-up, why even—”\n “Ensign Kang!” the Doctor shouted, and finally, Lucy broke off her tirade. “Your performance in that… ‘two-bit hack holonovel’ that I wrote…” \n Lucy cringed. \n “…is not the issue. The goal was never to judge you by the outcome of the scenario, but to assess your mental condition by your behavior under unfamiliar and stressful circumstances.”\n Lucy absorbed this fact and struggled to process it. “Is this because I bought a hat, then?”\n The Doctor sighed. “No. It was not any single decision or mistake that you made.”\n “Then please, Doctor,” said Lucy, “explain it to me. I really can’t understand.”\n The Doctor paused to consider. “And how does that make you feel?”\n “Upset,” said Lucy.\n “Upset how?” said the Doctor. “Does it make you sad? Or are you afraid for your career? Your future?”\n “No,” said Lucy, “I’m angry, and I’m frustrated. I had a goal. I was supposed to save those hostages, but it was a total Kobayashi Maru. The only way to break the stalemate would have been to start killing terrorists.”\n “And did that ever cross your mind as a legitimate option?” said the Doctor.\n “Not for a moment,” said Lucy. “Even if we could have killed them all with zero collateral damage, which I highly doubt, and in spite of the fact I didn’t agree with their methods or their goals, it wasn’t my place to pick sides in their conflict. It was a classic Prime Directive scenario.”\n The Doctor paused, momentarily considering her point. “An interesting perspective.”\n “Is that why I failed?”\n The Doctor uttered a frustrated sigh. “I told you, it was nothing specific! There was no ‘right’ answer! Ensign…” He grasped for the right words for a moment before going on, “You can’t feel pain. Your shoe melted into your foot, and you didn’t even limp. And your emotional responses are completely atypical. You showed more concern for the shoe than for your foot, and you demonstrated as much sympathy for the terrorists as for the victims.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[14, 18, "PER"], [66, 73, "LOC"], [101, 107, "PER"], [311, 315, "PER"], [621, 643, "PER"], [689, 693, "PER"], [822, 826, "PER"], [866, 873, "LOC"], [889, 893, "PER"], [952, 959, "LOC"], [1003, 1009, "PER"], [1057, 1061, "PER"], [1142, 1148, "PER"], [1173, 1188, "LOC"], [1194, 1198, "PER"], [1203, 1208, "PER"], [1265, 1269, "PER"], [1278, 1284, "PER"], [1347, 1351, "PER"], [1361, 1375, "PER"], [1477, 1483, "PER"], [1512, 1516, "PER"], [1809, 1817, "LOC"], [1859, 1870, "PER"], [1877, 1883, "PER"], [1906, 1910, "PER"], [2002, 2006, "PER"], [2203, 2207, "PER"], [2301, 2307, "PER"], [2394, 2400, "PER"], [2408, 2412, "PER"], [2466, 2472, "PER"], [2543, 2547, "PER"], [2572, 2578, "PER"], [2664, 2668, "PER"], [2774, 2788, "SHIP"], [2942, 2948, "PER"], [2976, 2980, "PER"], [3248, 3254, "PER"], [3358, 3364, "PER"], [3459, 3465, "PER"]]}
{"id": 21, "text": "“I was mediating!” Lucy retorted, but the Doctor went on regardless.\n “You approached them without even trying to work out out a contingency plan or find a weapon for self-defense. They could have shot you where you stood just to make a point!”\n “They were scared!” said Lucy. “They needed someone to hear their demands, or they would have started killing hostages even sooner. Your writing made it obvious that I was the one that would be expected to step forward, so I did. I was just following the plot.”\n “As you saw it, perhaps,” said the Doctor. “But the most serious problem had nothing to do with your choices or your emotions. Ensign, your biosynthetic implants just dropped the entire French language into your head, and you didn’t skip a beat. You hardly even noticed, until I pointed it out. That degree of cognitive synergy speaks to the profound extent to which an unknown alien artificial intelligence has insinuated itself into your brain.”\n “What?” said Lucy. “You don’t think I’m Lucy Kang anymore? What am I then, a Borg?”\n “You’re still you,” said the Doctor, his voice much softer than before. “You’re still Lucille Kang. Your capacity for empathy, your cleverness, your wit, that’s all you. But you’re something more, now, too. That’s what frightens me.”\n “Well then, how long is it going to take, to prove I can be trusted again?” said Lucy.\n The Doctor shook his head. “Hopefully, we won’t have to deal with that. Commander Chakotay is back on that station right now, looking for a way to reverse what was done to you.”\n Lucy tasted something bitter. “Why didn’t anyone tell me?” she said.\n “You’re right, I should have,” said the Doctor. “I was preoccupied with setting up your assessment.”\n Lucy shook her head. “You’re not the only person who could have let me know. The Captain, or Chakotay, or anyone on the senior staff could have told me what they intended to do. I’m just an afterthought in all this, aren’t I?”\n “Far from it, Ensign,” said the Doctor.\n “But what if the cure is just as grisly and invasive as the cause? Will they even ask my permission, or will they just order me to hop back into that pod?”\n “Ensign…”\n Lucy shook her head. “They didn’t even give me a chance, did they? They saw I looked different, they saw I acted different, and immediately they just assumed they had to ‘turn me back’ somehow. I can’t even imagine what that would be like, Doctor! All this trauma and misery that people keep expecting me to feel? Why would I want that?”\n The Doctor looked perplexed. “You don’t want to be… you again, Lucy?”\n “I am me, Doctor! You said it yourself! I’m me, and I’m more! And your bogus test is a far cry from convincing me that that’s a bad thing.”\n The Doctor’s confusion faded, giving rise to a carefully neutral expression. “I’ll be sure to pass that sentiment on to the Captain, then,” he said.\n “Well… good!” said Lucy. “I’m a member of this crew, dammit. I deserve to be heard.”\n The Doctor nodded. “Of course.”\n With that settled, Lucy walked out of the Doctor’s office and back into sickbay. “So, what am I supposed to do now? Sit on a biobed and twiddle my thumbs?”\n The Doctor shook his head. “Your security clearances are still on hold, but you’re clear to visit all unrestricted areas of the ship. You’ll have two security personnel with you at all times outside of your quarters, and your activities will be monitored.”\n Lucy opened her mouth to complain, but the Doctor cut her off. \n “Those are the captain’s orders. Furthermore, you’re to report back to sickbay at oh-seven-hundred hours for a complete medical assessment, so I can monitor the progression of your condition. And keep me informed of any new symptoms you may experience in the meantime. Those are my orders. Are we clear, Ensign?”\n “Yes, Doctor,” said Lucy, making every effort to stifle her resentment. As stacked as the test had seemed, she had to acknowledge that the Doctor knew what he was doing. Whether she agreed with him or not, his judgment must have had some merit, at least from a certain point of view. Continuing to belabor the point would only serve to reinforce his conclusions.\n Lucy turned to the sickbay doors and walked straight through, studiously avoiding eye contact with Owen or Bobby as she passed between them. Without looking back, she knew they had followed her through the door by their soft footsteps on the carpeted deck.\n Lucy pondered what to do with the rest of her day. She couldn’t even enter the BNG labs without her security clearances. She found it a little absurd that she would even contemplate visiting her workplace on a day off, and yet, she yearned to do just that. Voyager only had a couple other technicians that were even qualified to do her job, and they would both be pulling extra shifts for the foreseeable future to cover for her absence. Even if she couldn’t take on any of the work, she would have liked to check in on them and offer some moral support. Maybe she could catch up with Raeger or Kigon in the commissary later to see if they could use any work advice or moral support, but right now they were sure to be in the middle of a shift or deep in a sleep cycle.\n She wasn’t hungry, so there was no reason to visit the commissary right now. She was absolutely sick of holograms, so obviously the Holodeck was out of the question. Lucy supposed she might as well just return to her quarters.\n Crewman Jarvin passed Lucy in the corridor. His step faltered when he saw her, and his eyes darted over her several times.\n “Something the matter, Crewman?” said Lucy.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[19, 23, "PER"], [42, 48, "PER"], [271, 275, "PER"], [544, 550, "PER"], [636, 642, "PER"], [971, 975, "PER"], [998, 1007, "PER"], [1035, 1039, "SPEC"], [1072, 1078, "PER"], [1129, 1141, "PER"], [1359, 1363, "PER"], [1370, 1376, "PER"], [1438, 1456, "PER"], [1545, 1549, "PER"], [1655, 1661, "PER"], [1717, 1721, "PER"], [1798, 1805, "PER"], [1810, 1818, "PER"], [1959, 1965, "PER"], [1977, 1983, "PER"], [2144, 2150, "PER"], [2154, 2158, "PER"], [2394, 2400, "PER"], [2497, 2503, "PER"], [2556, 2560, "PER"], [2574, 2580, "PER"], [2709, 2717, "PER"], [2829, 2836, "PER"], [2874, 2878, "PER"], [2945, 2951, "PER"], [2993, 2997, "PER"], [3016, 3024, "PER"], [3046, 3053, "LOC"], [3135, 3141, "PER"], [3389, 3393, "PER"], [3432, 3438, "PER"], [3469, 3478, "PER"], [3525, 3532, "LOC"], [3758, 3764, "PER"], [3774, 3780, "PER"], [3788, 3792, "PER"], [3907, 3913, "PER"], [4132, 4136, "PER"], [4151, 4158, "LOC"], [4231, 4235, "PER"], [4239, 4244, "PER"], [4390, 4394, "PER"], [4469, 4477, "LOC"], [4647, 4654, "SHIP"], [4975, 4981, "PER"], [4985, 4990, "PER"], [4998, 5008, "LOC"], [5293, 5301, "LOC"], [5327, 5331, "PER"], [5389, 5403, "PER"], [5411, 5415, "PER"], [5536, 5543, "PER"], [5551, 5555, "PER"]]}
{"id": 22, "text": "CHAPTER 7\n “I say we fly Voyager in there and ram a few photon torpedoes up their aft ventral porthole! See how they like that!” Lieutenant Torres raged. \n The senior staff was gathered in the conference room, minus Chakotay, who was still being held captive on the space station. They hadn’t been sitting at the conference table more than a couple minutes before Torres was back on her feet, though, pacing back and forth down the length of the table.\n Janeway regarded the hot-headed engineer patiently, deciding it would be better just to let Torres vent her frustrations and get it out of the way. After all, she was just giving voice to the frustration that pervaded the whole room. They were angry, and they were worried for Chakotay, and everyone needed to acknowledge it—everyone but Tuvok, of course.\n  “The Delurididug Trade Hub holds significant strategic advantages over Voyager,” he Vulcan-splained. “It exists within an isolated region of space, over which it appears to control both ingress and egress. It has far more advanced technology than Voyager, it generates far more power than Voyager, and its immense bulk likely hides defensive systems significantly more formidable than Voyager’s. Such a confrontation is unlikely to end in our favor.”\n Torres waved off his objection. “We don’t even know if the station is armed. We scanned every inch of it, and I didn’t see an operational weapons system.”\n “Indeed,” said Tuvok, “We have been able to discern very little about key functions on the station. We cannot identify a computer core, a power source, or any form of warp field generator. And yet, we have ample evidence that the station has each of these systems. Therefore, the station is either employing technology so foreign and advanced that we cannot recognize it, or it is somehow disguising these systems from our scans. The same could go for weapons.”\n B’elanna shook her head. “It’s unmanned. Whatever advanced technology may or may not be on board is useless if no one is there to operate it.”\n Tuvok arched an eyebrow. “Is it your contention that the A.I. of the station is incapable of autonomous self-defense?”\n B’elanna looked uncertain for a moment. Then she threw her hands up and plopped herself back into her chair. “Oh, how the hell should I know?” she said.\n Tuvok nodded. “Well put, Lieutenant,” he said. “We do not know enough at this time to justify putting Voyager at risk.”\n “So what, then?” said Torres, “Do we abandon Commander Chakotay? Or do we play along? Throw ourselves on the mercy of a long-defunct court and the judgment of a malfunctioning hologram?”\n “Whether or not we take that course should depend on the laws of the court in question. I am still in the process of familiarizing myself with the Delurididug legal code. It is a curious system of governance; a technocratic meritocracy, its laws rigid, yet robust; idiosyncratic, yet imminently logical. Once we have an adequate understanding of their laws, we may be able to formulate an effective defense for Commander Chakotay.”\n “And what if we can’t?” said Harry. “What if we don’t have a case? Then what do we do?”\n “Maybe we can plan a jailbreak,” said Tom.\n “I would calculate our odds of securing Commander Chakotay’s escape as less than one point five percent, given their ability to neutralize our weapons inside of the station,” said Tuvok.\n “And even if we manage to pull it off, we can forget about getting a wormhole to the Federation,” said Harry, “Or curing Ensign Kang.”\n “I’m afraid there are other hurdles where Ensign Kang is concerned,” said the Doctor.\n The others turned to the wall monitor that displayed the Doctor’s image.\n “What’s the status of your patient, Doctor?” said Captain Janeway.\n The Doctor took a moment to consider his response. “Well, physically, her condition is downright superhuman. I’ve been monitoring her vitals and activities remotely since she left sickbay. She spent an hour in the deck eight gymnasium, during which time she performed a complete calisthenics routine at three times standard gravity, ran twenty-five kilometers, and burned over four thousand calories. Her pulse never exceeded one hundred twenty beats a minute, and as far as I can tell from remote sensors, there was none of the lactic acid buildup in her tissues that such a strenuous workout should have produced. Afterward, she ordered an eighteen hundred calorie meal from her personal replicator, and at last check, she appeared to be sleeping. I’ll be able to tell you more about her physical condition in the morning, after her next physical.\n “Psychologically… The results of my assessment were deeply ambiguous. Her problem-solving abilities are excellent, but prior testing suggests this is a pre-existing trait. Her regard for life and her empathic instincts are very strong, but by the same token, her capacity for emotional detachment is lacking. Again, this matches the results of her prior psychological assessments. In these regards, her personality is essentially intact.\n “One item of concern is her lack of cautious reflexes. If she saw a snake by her foot, for instance, she would not jump away from it on instinct. She would register the snake, decide consciously if it were a threat, and reason out an appropriate reaction. By the time she decided what to do, the snake might have already bitten her ankle. Her power of reasoning is excellent, but in emotionally fraught and emergent situations, I’m afraid this cognitive deficit will present a powerful liability.\n “Of even greater concern are the cognitive enhancements that she has begun demonstrating. During the assessment, I chose to deprive the ensign of her universal translator. Seeing as many of the characters in the program spoke only 20th Century French, I thought this would provide an additional challenge. Instead, the ensign learned a new language, fluently, in a matter of minutes—just by being in the presence of people speaking it. The implants are certainly interacting with her brain, providing cognitive enhancements in specialized tasks like language acquisition. As to any other ways they may be affecting her cognition, I can’t yet say.\n “But what concerns me most of all is that the ensign is starting to show a strong reticence towards the notion of reversing her condition.”\n There was a beat of quiet around the conference table as the staff absorbed the Doctor’s meaning. Evidently, none of the others had considered that Ensign Kang might not want to be cured.\n “Well, I guess I can’t really blame her,” said Tom.\n The others all looked at Tom, and he sat forward in his chair.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[25, 32, "SHIP"], [129, 146, "PER"], [216, 224, "PER"], [364, 370, "PER"], [454, 461, "PER"], [546, 552, "PER"], [731, 739, "PER"], [792, 797, "PER"], [817, 838, "LOC"], [883, 890, "SHIP"], [896, 902, "SPEC"], [1059, 1066, "SHIP"], [1101, 1108, "SHIP"], [1197, 1206, "SHIP"], [1264, 1270, "PER"], [1323, 1330, "LOC"], [1435, 1440, "PER"], [1883, 1891, "PER"], [2027, 2032, "PER"], [2147, 2155, "PER"], [2301, 2306, "PER"], [2326, 2336, "PER"], [2403, 2410, "SHIP"], [2444, 2450, "PER"], [2467, 2485, "PER"], [2757, 2768, "SPEC"], [3021, 3039, "PER"], [3072, 3077, "PER"], [3170, 3173, "PER"], [3216, 3236, "PER"], [3356, 3361, "PER"], [3467, 3472, "PER"], [3449, 3459, "LOC"], [3485, 3496, "PER"], [3542, 3553, "PER"], [3578, 3584, "PER"], [3644, 3652, "PER"], [3697, 3703, "PER"], [3711, 3726, "PER"], [3733, 3739, "PER"], [3909, 3916, "LOC"], [5188, 5193, "SPEC"], [5087, 5092, "SPEC"], [5315, 5320, "SPEC"], [5653, 5659, "PER"], [5836, 5842, "PER"], [6211, 6217, "PER"], [6386, 6394, "PER"], [6454, 6465, "PER"], [6542, 6545, "PER"], [6573, 6576, "PER"]]}
{"id": 23, "text": "“Hey, she’s got superpowers,” he said. “She’s faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.”\n Tuvok’s eyebrow crawled about halfway up his scalp.\n “Figuratively, I mean,” said Tom. “And she’s unrestrained by negative emotions. That sounds like it would be hard to give up.”\n “Actually,” said the Doctor, “She has quite a few negative emotions. Unfortunately, without the ability to express sorrow about her circumstances, her emotional release seems to come primarily in the form of anger. She’s resentful, Captain. She feels she should have been consulted before Commander Chakotay led a risky away mission on her behalf. She resents being treated with suspicion and kept from resuming her post. So far, her reason and her sense of empathy seem to be working to defuse her anger, but I’m not convinced it will last.”\n Janeway nodded to the Doctor. “Well, for what it’s worth, I think she has a point,” she said. Then she addressed the room. \n “Torres, Kim, get to work analyzing all the data we have on the structure of the station. We need to learn as much as we can about its external hardpoints and its internal structure. Paris, get with Lieutenant Ayala and start on that jailbreak scenario. \n “Tuvok, I’ll need you sorting out their laws and devising our case. Gather all the help you need, from any department. \n “If we can beat their legal system, we will. If we can’t, we go with a jailbreak. And in case that fails, Torres, Kim… once we know everything we possibly can about that station, start working on a way to cripple it. Once we have the upper hand, maybe the station will listen to reason. But that’s our last resort.\n “Does anyone have questions?”\n “What about Ensign Kang, sir?” said the Doctor.\n Janeway rested her chin on her hand a moment, her gaze far away, as she considered the problem. “That is the question, isn’t it?” Finally, she braced her hands against the table and pushed herself up to her feet. “I think it’s time I paid her a visit. Now, let’s get to work, people. You’re dismissed.”\n  \n \n  \n Lucy writhed languidly against the silky fabric of her bedsheets, reveling in the afterglow. Owen rested his head on his hands and stared up at the deckhead, an easy, almost sedated smile on his face. She rolled over to face him, propping herself up on her elbow.\n He cast a sidelong glance her way, and she quirked a questioning eyebrow. He reached out and ran his hand through her hair just above her left ear, gently massaging her scalp with his fingertips.\n “Are you petting me like a dog right now?” said Lucy, although she made no move to stop him. His touch sent happy shivers through her whole body.\n “Just making sure you’re not secretly a Deltan,” said Owen.\n Lucy gave a breathy chuckle. “Why, because you’re afraid my lovemaking has left you incurably insane? Or is it because my hair looks like a wig?” Deltans had a near-human aspect, minus cranial hair. They were also legendary love-makers, with passions so intense they could literally drive a human mad. Or that was the legend, at any rate. Lucy doubted it could be entirely accurate.\n “Definitely the first one,” he said.\n Lucy nearly made a pithy retort about how with her enhancements, anything was possible, but she held back—in part, because she was sick of bringing up the subject, and in part, because she realized it was true.\n “Do you think this might have been a mistake?” she said.\n Owen’s expression sobered. His hand slid from her hair to her cheek, cupping her jawline with his palm. He shook his head. “No.”\n Lucy sighed. She couldn’t help nuzzling into his hand a little bit, but she couldn’t ignore the implications of what they’d just done. She leaned back, breaking contact.\n “What if I’m contagious, somehow?” she asked.\n “The Doctor wouldn’t have let you out of sickbay,” he said.\n Lucy shrugged. “What does he know? I’m infected with technology centuries ahead of ours.

Lucy leaned closer to him.\n “Oh, that’s what it is?” said Lucy. She brought her face within a couple centimeters of his. She could feel his breath on her cheek.\n “Uh huh,” he said.\n “Yeah?” she said, and she kissed him. He returned her kiss readily, and things progressed quickly from there. Soon, the world seemed to fade away around them, until nothing was left but those points where their two bodies met; hands exploring sensitive flesh, legs brushing legs, interlocking lips, conjoined hips, and nothing in between them but friction and perspiration.\n Afterward, Lucy and Owen both stared up at the deckhead. Lucy felt as blissful and sensuous as ever, but Owen was starting to doze off, his eyelids slowly drifting shut.\n Then, that same nagging doubt popped back into her mind. “Do you think the Doctor will be mad?” she said.\n Owen opened his eyes again and looked at her. “Are you going to tell him?”\n “I have another check-up first thing in the morning,” said Lucy. “I’m sure he’ll figure it out.”\n Owen’s brow furrowed. “Well, he never told you not to have sex, did he?”\n “No,” said Lucy. “But now it seems like kind of a no-brainer, right?”\n Owen shrugged. “Well, what’s done is done.

Lucy realized she was getting pretty hungry. \n “You wanna get some—” \n “Sorry.”\n They’d spoken at the same time.\n “For what?” said Lucy. \n “I mean…” said Owen, and he studied her face for a second.

{"id": 25, "text": "CHAPTER 8\n Chakotay sampled a dab of protein paste and grimaced. It resembled old, plain oatmeal, congealed and devoid of flavor. Chakotay took a moment to gird himself, then he picked up the tube of paste and squeezed its contents directly into his mouth.\n “Ugh, ack.” He grabbed the water bladder he’d been provided with his meal and bit down on the valve to let the liquid free, washing down the slimy paste with three deep gulps of lukewarm water.\n “I know, putrid stuff,” said Hux. “Not that I have any direct experience, mind you, but I’ve fed similar concoctions to twelve thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two other detained visitors over the millennia, and all but one hundred and fourteen of them provided unfavorable reviews.”\n Chakotay took one more pull on the water bladder and swished it around his mouth, clearing the last bits of paste from his palate before swallowing.\n “One and a half stars,” said Chakotay. “I’ve had worse, but not by much.”\n Hux nodded thoughtfully, no doubt adding another negative review to his tally.\n “Well, it’ll keep you nourished, at any rate. The Delurididug Trade Federation does not neglect its detainees.”\n Chakotay was forced to agree. The room in which the station held him captive resembled a budget suite at a Rigelian hostel more than a holding cell. The cot in the corner was clean and reasonably comfortable, there were a table and three chairs, there was a food slot on the wall where the protein paste had materialized, and there was an interface screen on the wall, although it was off, and it had no obvious controls. A single floating orb of yellow-white light hovered near the ceiling, providing comfortable illumination for the room.\n Chakotay contemplated the depleted tube of protein paste on the table in front of him, wishing there was something else he could eat. The modest serving of paste would probably sustain him in his captivity until his shipmates returned, but it was far from filling.\n Hux took a seat opposite Chakotay at the table and leaned in, resting his illusory weight on his holographic elbows. “Would you like to try something you might find a bit more palatable?” said the projection.\n Chakotay arched an eyebrow. No doubt, it would come at a cost. It occurred to Chakotay that he still didn’t know what the Trade Hub actually traded for.\n “Unfortunately, I haven’t got any currency,” said Chakotay.\n “That’s not such a problem,” said Hux. “The Trade Hub receives many visitors who have no formal trade relations or currency exchanges with the Delurididug Trade Federation. We are more than happy to barter.”\n Chakotay sighed and sat back in his chair. “Well, I don’t have anything to barter, either. However, Voyager has stores of dilithium crystal, gold-pressed latinum, verterium cortenide…”\n Hux shook his head. “I’m sorry, but from what I can gather of your people’s technological development, I doubt you possess any kind of mineral wealth that we can’t synthesize for ourselves on the station.”\n That brought Chakotay up short. “Well… Why don’t you try me? What would you be interested in?”\n Hux looked dubious. “Crystalline benamite? Bioavailable kironide? Anti-protomatter? Polyphasic neutronium? Hexaburnium?”\n Chakotay shook his head, suddenly feeling a lot less confident that they would be able to win over the station’s cooperation through trade. He’d never even heard of a few of the things Hux listed. Still, he pushed forward. “We might be able to track down some of those things on the other side of the wormhole if you make it worth our while,” he said.\n Hux shook his head. “By the time you returned, your access point would be long gone.”\n The hairs on Chakotay’s neck rose, and he sat up in his chair. He reined himself in, though, not wanting his captor to catch him fretting. Affecting an air of nonchalance, he adjusted the sleeve of his uniform and said, “The wormhole isn’t a permanent structure? How much longer will it last?”\n Hux put his hands up in a placating gesture, as if Chakotay had exploded in panic. “It should last long enough for us to conclude our business, so long as your shipmates don’t dawdle. Maintaining the access point over the long term simply isn’t cost effective during the current Travel Network maintenance cycle, I’m afraid.”\n Chakotay considered the hologram’s words for a moment. “I’m curious, how long has the current maintenance cycle been in progress?”\n “Four thousand, one hundred and forty-one Earth years,” said Hux.\n “That can’t be right,” said Chakotay. “What kind of maintenance cycle is measured in millennia?”\n Hux shrugged. “We apologize for any inconvenience. Occasional, unforeseen delays are inevitable in eight-dimensional, sub-spatial architecture projects of this magnitude.”\n “Well, maybe there’s a way for Voyager to help you hasten your repairs.”\n Hux shook his head sadly. “I’m afraid that’s out of the question.”", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[11, 19, "PER"], [130, 138, "PER"], [482, 485, "PER"], [740, 748, "PER"], [919, 927, "PER"], [965, 968, "PER"], [1095, 1123, "ORG"], [1158, 1166, "PER"], [1265, 1273, "SPEC"], [1700, 1708, "PER"], [1966, 1969, "PER"], [1991, 1999, "PER"], [2176, 2184, "PER"], [2254, 2262, "PER"], [2298, 2307, "ORG"], [2380, 2388, "PER"], [2425, 2428, "PER"], [2435, 2444, "ORG"], [2534, 2562, "ORG"], [2600, 2608, "PER"], [2700, 2707, "SHIP"], [2786, 2789, "PER"], [3006, 3014, "PER"], [3089, 3092, "PER"], [3211, 3219, "PER"], [3396, 3399, "PER"], [3564, 3567, "PER"], [3664, 3674, "PER"], [3946, 3949, "PER"], [3997, 4005, "PER"], [4225, 4239, "ORG"], [4273, 4281, "PER"], [4466, 4469, "PER"], [4500, 4508, "PER"], [4570, 4573, "PER"], [4774, 4781, "SHIP"], [4817, 4820, "PER"]]}
{"id": 26, "text": "“Why?” said Chakotay. “We’ll soon have this current misunderstanding out of the way. I hope that when that’s taken care of, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship.”\n “I’m heartened to hear you say that,” said Hux. “I hope you’re right. But the workings of the Delurididug Travel Network are highly proprietary. We can’t contract third-party labor. I can’t even discuss issues of procurement with non-Delurididug parties.”\n Chakotay did his best to push down his rising frustration and disappointment. “Well, if you aren’t interested in our material wealth, and you don’t want help with your wormholes, what are you interested in?”\n “Why, intellectual property, of course!”\n “Of what sort?” said Chakotay.\n “All sorts! Charts, schematics, scientific treatises, genomic and proteomic sequences, artistic and cultural works, you name it!”\n Chakotay smiled. Voyager had detailed star charts from all four quadrants of the galaxy, a vast cultural database cataloging works from thousands of distinct civilizations, and similarly vast scientific and medical databases to match. If those were things the Delurididug valued, then the crew of Voyager was about to be VIPs. “In that case, Mr. Hux, I think we’ll be able to do business after all.”\n  \n \n  \n “I think we’ll be able to hold our own, sir,” said Lieutenant Ayala. “At least briefly. Hopefully, long enough to free Chakotay and make an emergency beam out.”\n Janeway found his confidence refreshing, if a bit over-optimistic. \n The crew had worked straight through Gamma shift on devising a strategy to deal with the space station. The captain had ordered everyone to take a four-hour rest so they could attack the problem with fresh eyes, but then the telemetry from the wormhole started showing alarming signs. The subspace distortion that defined its aperture had abruptly weakened, and when it returned, it was far less stable. The wormhole was guttering like a candle at the end of its wick. According to their best estimates, the wormhole would flicker out in four to six hours.\n The captain called this emergency briefing to learn what all her crew had come up with to this point, hoping it would be enough. \n “What makes you think you’ll be able to beam out?” said Torres. “We tried to beam Chakotay off the station before we left last time. It shrouded his comm signal and his biosigns behind some kind of dampening field.”\n “We’ll do it the same way we beamed Lopez off of Omekla III,” replied Ayala.\n Torres smiled at the memory she shared with her fellow Maquis, then translated for the benefit of the Starfleeters gathered around the conference table. “Transport enhancers,” she said. “Assembled in the field from a comm device, a tricorder, and some kind of a signal amplifier. I could modify the away team’s equipment to serve the purpose. Nothing would look out of the ordinary when they’re scanned by the station.”\n “What would you use for an amplifier?” asked Janeway.\n “The feedback converter of a compression phaser rifle should do the trick,” she said.\n “There is no way to know whether such a device would penetrate the Delurididug’s dampening field,” said Tuvok.\n “And I doubt the station is just going to stand by while you reconfigure your equipment,” said Harry.\n “That’s where frequency-modulated phaser rifles and a well-timed photonic feedback pulse come in,” said Lieutenant Paris.\n “Oh?” said Torres, her curiosity piqued. “Do tell!”\n “Based on tricorder scans from our last encounter with the station, it looks like it neutralizes our phaser fire by matching and counteracting the pulse frequency. Sound familiar?”\n “The Borg,” said Ensign Kim.\n “Exactly,” said Tom. “We think the station can identify our weapons’ firing frequency when it scans us coming onto the station, so it can adapt its countermeasures before we even fire a shot. But Starfleet has figured out a few tricks for handling Borg-style adaptive countermeasures. It’s all about modulating the phasers’ firing frequencies on the fly. If we can smuggle in a few frequency modulators, maybe disguised as data nodules or tricorder accessories, we can modify our phasers in a flash.”\n “But even if we can make use of our phasers, it’s unlikely we’ll be able to overpower the station’s defensive systems,” said Captain Janeway. “We’ve seen evidence of tractor emitters and holograms, so it’s a sure bet they’ll also have force fields, and probably automated weapons systems resistant to phaser fire.”\n Lieutenant Ayala nodded. “That’s why we’ll trigger a photonic feedback pulse,” he said. “It should destabilize holographic projectors, blind internal sensors, and disrupt confinement beams or tractor emitters in a local area, at least for a short time. We’ll need to interlink at least six tricorders with a power cell from one of our phasers, and it would probably only buy us a few seconds, but if we can use that window to disable whatever measures the station is using to detain Commander Chakotay and assemble the transport enhancers…”\n Captain Janeway began rubbing her temples with her fingertips, trying to release the tension she felt building up before it bloomed into a full-fledged headache. “So… assuming the station lets us come anywhere near the commander in the first place, and assuming the station doesn’t notice the modifications to our equipment and anticipate our tactics, and assuming the station’s systems will be vulnerable to a photonic feedback pulse, and assuming that the pulse will give us enough time to reconfigure our equipment, and assuming our phasers will be capable of disabling any remaining defenses, and assuming an improvised transport enhancer will be capable of penetrating the station’s dampening field… we’ll be home free?” she said. “Did I miss anything?”\n “Even if we are able to get Chakotay off of the station, it is unlikely that the station will allow us to escape through the wormhole,” said Tuvok.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[12, 20, "PER"], [217, 220, "PER"], [268, 294, "ORG"], [408, 419, "SPEC"], [431, 439, "PER"], [703, 711, "PER"], [845, 853, "PER"], [862, 869, "PER"], [1105, 1116, "SPEC"], [1142, 1149, "SHIP"], [1187, 1194, "PER"], [1305, 1321, "PER"], [1373, 1381, "PER"], [1416, 1423, "PER"], [2047, 2054, "PER"], [2230, 2236, "PER"], [2256, 2264, "PER"], [2427, 2432, "PER"], [2440, 2450, "LOC"], [2461, 2466, "PER"], [2469, 2475, "PER"], [2524, 2530, "ORG"], [2571, 2583, "ORG"], [2935, 2942, "PER"], [3099, 3112, "SPEC"], [3136, 3141, "PER"], [3239, 3244, "PER"], [3351, 3367, "PER"], [3381, 3387, "PER"], [3610, 3614, "SPEC"], [3622, 3632, "PER"], [3651, 3654, "PER"], [3831, 3840, "ORG"], [3883, 3887, "SPEC"], [4262, 4277, "PER"], [4453, 4469, "PER"], [4936, 4954, "PER"], [4995, 5010, "PER"], [5783, 5791, "PER"], [5896, 5901, "PER"]]}
{"id": 27, "text": "Janeway sighed. “Right. Let’s table this option for now. Ayala, Paris, you came up with some good ideas under the circumstances, but it just isn’t going to cut it.”\n Paris and Ayala exchanged a look, disappointed, but not surprised. They’d been working on this plan all night. They probably knew better than anyone all the ways it could go wrong.\n “Understood, sir,” said Lieutenant Ayala.\n Janeway nodded and moved on with the briefing. “Torres, what have you got for us?”\n Lieutenant Torres took in a deep breath, leaned in, and in a calm, serious tone, said, “Let’s ram a few photon torpedos up their aft ventral porthole, see how they like that.”\n Janeway was not amused. She regarded her chief engineer with a sober expression for a moment, then said, “So, you’ve got nothing, I take it?”\n Torres let out a frustrated sigh. “I’ve been over the scans hundreds of times. I’ve found countless sensor-invisible points all over the station. I could only spot them after mapping the station’s whole power grid and looking for points where power goes in, but not out, or out, but not in. All of the ship’s vital systems must be hidden in those points. The problem is, there are just so damned many of them, and I’ve got no way of distinguishing a… shield generator from a coffee machine. And even if we could locate a vital system, that station’s a hard nut to crack. I’ve never even seen hexaburnium in person before, but this station is plated with the stuff from bow to stern, and we have no idea what their shields will even look like if we can’t get a look at their shield generators.” \n She shook her head and sat back in her chair again. “In all seriousness, the only weak points we might feasibly exploit are the portholes along the dorsal and ventral ridges, so my initial recommendation stands. Honestly, though, Captain? We’d have better odds with a boarding party.”\n Janeway took a deep, measured breath, allowing herself a moment to come to grips with her disappointment, and turned to Tuvok. “Please tell me you have a better option, Tuvok.”\n The tactical officer nodded thoughtfully. “Under Federation law, our exploration of derelict ships and structures is protected under ‘right of salvage.’ Unfortunately, Delurididug law doesn’t acknowledge salvage rights.”\n “So, by Delurididug law, we’re guilty,” said Janeway.\n “Not necessarily,” said Tuvok. “There are certain extenuating circumstances.”\n “Such as?” Janeway prompted.\n “The last time we spoke with the A.I. of the station, it did not seem to consider itself a derelict. It seemed to believe that it was operating more or less normally, and thus it treated the away team as returning customers,” said Tuvok.\n “So then, which is it?” said Torres, “Were we trespassers, or were we customers?”\n “That is one point of contention,” said Tuvok. “If the station concludes that our party was trespassing, it will charge Chakotay with unlawful entry and larceny, the penalties for which are severe. Our only defense will be a garbled transmission that included the word ‘welcome,’ and the automated activities of the station.”\n “Oh, that’s right!” said Tom, “It did welcome us, and it opened the door, too. I don’t see how it can accuse us of trespassing after that…”\n “It was automated, though,” said Harry. “Just because a house has a welcome mat, doesn’t mean you can come in any time you like.”\n “No,” said Tom, “But if it turns on the porch light and opens the front door for you as you walk up…”\n “It amounts to a judgment call,” said Tuvok. “The A.I. may decide the garbled transmission was sufficient to act as an invitation. Or, on the contrary, it may see the garbled state of the transmission and the lack of further contact as clear indicators that the station was not operational.”\n Janeway considered his words for a moment. “Lieutenant, what’s our best bet?”\n Tuvok cleared his throat. “So long as the station regards itself as functional, we should avoid any argument contingent on the station being abandoned or derelict. Instead, we should emphasize the lack of guidance the party received on their first arrival. The party was not given the Trade Hub Terms of Service. Therefore, they cannot have violated those Terms knowingly. Also, Captain, in the Delurididug legal system, an individual is not necessarily entitled to select their own legal counsel. The only parties empowered to speak on the defendant’s behalf are the defendant himself, an agent of the tribunal, or an individual with direct legal authority over the defendant.”\n “You mean me,” said Captain Janeway.\n Tuvok nodded. Janeway would have to join the away team, or else Chakotay would be forced to plead his own case with little or no knowledge of the away team’s strategies. \n It was obviously a risk. If something went wrong, Voyager would lose her captain and her first officer in one stroke. And yet, she wouldn’t have it any other way. She was frankly relieved to have an excuse to fight for her first officer in person. \n “Tell me, Tuvok, how likely am I to win this case?” said Janeway.\n “That depends,” said Tuvok, “on whether you are willing to bring Ensign Kang to act as a witness.”\n Janeway pinched her lips, clearly not enthralled with the idea. “Say I don’t?”\n “The station may hold you in contempt and suspend the hearing until we are willing to provide the required evidence. It will keep Chakotay in detention and refuse to allow us back on board. Alternatively, the station may choose to go ahead with the hearing anyway. Our evidence will consist largely of sensor logs from our shuttle and the after action reports of the away team, both of which the station is likely to treat with suspicion. It will consider our unwillingness to surrender its technology and intellectual property as evidence of belligerence and poor character. Our odds of winning are low. And even if it sides in our favor, it will still insist we allow it to reverse Kang’s augmentations, or else to pay for services rendered.”\n “And if we do let Kang act as a witness?” said Janeway.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 7, "PER"], [57, 62, "PER"], [64, 69, "PER"], [166, 171, "PER"], [176, 181, "PER"], [372, 388, "PER"], [391, 398, "PER"], [439, 445, "PER"], [475, 492, "PER"], [652, 659, "PER"], [795, 801, "PER"], [1739, 1764, "LOC"], [1821, 1828, "PER"], [1877, 1884, "PER"], [1997, 2002, "PER"], [2046, 2051, "PER"], [2059, 2075, "PER"], [2104, 2114, "GPE"], [2223, 2234, "SPEC"], [2285, 2296, "SPEC"], [2322, 2329, "PER"], [2356, 2361, "PER"], [2422, 2429, "PER"], [2672, 2677, "PER"], [2709, 2715, "PER"], [2803, 2808, "PER"], [2883, 2891, "PER"], [3115, 3118, "PER"], [3264, 3269, "PER"], [3373, 3376, "PER"], [3503, 3508, "PER"], [3758, 3765, "PER"], [3802, 3812, "PER"], [3837, 3842, "PER"], [4122, 4131, "ORG"], [4216, 4223, "PER"], [4232, 4243, "SPEC"], [4537, 4552, "PER"], [4555, 4560, "PER"], [4569, 4576, "PER"], [4619, 4627, "PER"], [4777, 4784, "PER"], [4987, 4992, "PER"], [5034, 5041, "PER"], [5065, 5070, "PER"], [5109, 5120, "PER"], [5144, 5151, "PER"], [5354, 5362, "PER"], [5908, 5914, "PER"], [5988, 5992, "PER"], [6017, 6024, "PER"]]}
{"id": 28, "text": "CHAPTER 9\n “Good news, Commander!” said Hux. The holographic avatar of the station apparated half a meter away from Chakotay’s face, startling him out of his fretful reverie. “Your crew have returned for you!”\n “They’re here now?” said Chakotay.\n “They’ve just arrived through the Travel Network, and hardly a moment to spare. I have to confess, Chakotay, I was starting to worry for you. The operating window for that access point ends in twenty-five minutes!”\n “Can you extend that?” said Chakotay. “By the time they come on board and the hearing gets underway…” He shook his head.\n Hux considered his point for a moment. “You’re right. I’ll need to enact emergency protocols to ensure that our business is concluded in a timely fashion.”\n “Or, you could extend the window another hour!”\n Hux turned his back on Chakotay while he was still talking and faced the screen on the wall of Chakotay’s cell, which flickered to life with a curious glyph for just a moment before opening a comm channel to Voyager’s shuttlecraft. Chakotay could see Captain Janeway, Lieutenant Paris, Ensigns Kim, Vorik, and Kang, plus Chief Vance and Crewman Thorold crowded into the small craft.\n Chakotay’s heart dropped at the sight of Ensign Kang. What could have possessed Kathryn to bring her back here?\n Hux clapped his hands with delight. “Oh, excellent! Everyone’s here. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Hux. I’ll be your host here at the Delurididug Trade Hub.”\n Janeway glanced past the hologram, and her eyes locked on Chakotay. She looked back to Hux and said, “Hello, Mr. Hux. I’m Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager. May I speak to Commander Chakotay?”\n “Captain, I’m sorry, but time is short. I need your permission to transport your party directly onto the station.”\n “Send us the coordinates, and we’ll start beaming over when we’re ready.”\n Hux shook his head. “Sorry, but we have to follow some very specific guidelines here, and as I said, time is short. I need your permission to bypass standard docking protocols and transport your party immediately. Otherwise, I’ll have to confiscate our stolen property and send you back out of Trade Hub space, straight away.”\n Janeway’s expression went icy, and there was steel in her tone. “You won’t lay a finger on any member of my crew until we’ve had our hearing, Mr. Hux. I’ve familiarized myself with your legal guidelines, and–”\n “I’m really very sorry, Captain, but as I have told you more than once already, time is short! I must have your answer now: Will you permit me to beam your party aboard?”\n Janeway hesitated for just a moment before nodding.\n “Excellent. Everyone, please rise to your feet and collect any items you might need for the hearing. Is anyone staying behind on the shuttle?”\n “No,” said Janeway, and she looked to Paris, who nodded and began entering commands on his console. “The shuttle will mind itself for the time being.”\n “Very well,” said Hux. “I’ll bring you all aboard in fifteen seconds.”\n With that, the screen cut off. Hux turned back to Chakotay, beaming with excitement. “I think we’ve just narrowly avoided a disastrous outcome, Commander.”\n Chakotay wasn’t so sure.\n  \n \n  \n When the channel cut out, Lucy and the other members of the away team leaped to their feet and set about readying their equipment. Lucy had less to carry than the others; everyone else had shoulder bags with data nodules, tricorders, padds, samples of ship’s stores, and phaser rifles in place of standard-issue hand phasers. \n All Lucy had was her trusty tricorder and a standard-issue phaser. She double-checked the settings on her phaser, then unsheathed her tricorder and set about reviewing its calibration and configuration.\n Abruptly, the deck beneath her feet seemed to light up with an eerie, pure white glow. Lucy looked up and discovered she wasn’t on the shuttlecraft anymore. She found herself standing on a glowing, circular dais in a wide, domed chamber. Considering the light-up flooring, the featureless, alabaster walls, and the station’s holographic salesman staring her directly in the eye, Lucy assumed she’d been beamed onto the station.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[23, 32, "PER"], [40, 43, "PER"], [116, 126, "PER"], [236, 244, "PER"], [281, 295, "LOC"], [346, 354, "PER"], [491, 499, "PER"], [585, 588, "PER"], [791, 794, "PER"], [814, 822, "PER"], [886, 896, "PER"], [999, 1008, "SHIP"], [1023, 1031, "PER"], [1042, 1057, "PER"], [1059, 1075, "PER"], [1085, 1088, "PER"], [1090, 1095, "PER"], [1101, 1105, "PER"], [1112, 1124, "PER"], [1128, 1143, "PER"], [1175, 1185, "PER"], [1216, 1227, "PER"], [1255, 1262, "PER"], [1288, 1291, "PER"], [1397, 1400, "PER"], [1432, 1453, "LOC"], [1457, 1464, "PER"], [1515, 1523, "PER"], [1544, 1547, "PER"], [1566, 1573, "PER"], [1579, 1602, "PER"], [1619, 1626, "SHIP"], [1643, 1661, "PER"], [1666, 1673, "PER"], [1856, 1859, "PER"], [2150, 2165, "LOC"], [2184, 2193, "PER"], [2326, 2333, "PER"], [2419, 2426, "PER"], [2567, 2574, "PER"], [2775, 2782, "PER"], [2802, 2807, "PER"], [2934, 2937, "PER"], [3019, 3022, "PER"], [3038, 3046, "PER"], [3132, 3141, "PER"], [3145, 3153, "PER"], [3205, 3209, "PER"], [3310, 3314, "PER"], [3511, 3515, "PER"], [3798, 3802, "PER"], [4090, 4094, "PER"]]}
{"id": 29, "text": "“Hello, Ensign Kang,” said Hux. “I’m sorry we didn’t get a chance to meet on your last visit. How are those augmentations treating you?”\n “Hello, Hux,” said Lucy. She glanced around and noted the other members of the away team also standing on raised circular platforms of their own, and Chakotay was there with the rest of them, although his platform was surrounded with a shimmering forcefield. The platforms were strung like pearls on a choker around a shallow depression five meters wide.\n Hux stood at the center of the chamber, his feet a good half meter lower than the away team’s, and yet he towered over them, standing at least four meters tall. Lucy regarded the projection cooly, saying nothing more. After a moment, Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway.\n “Thank you for agreeing to come aboard under such unorthodox circumstances,” said Hux.\n “You didn’t give me much choice,” said Captain Janeway.\n “That’s true,” said Hux, tilting his head in consideration. “None of the alternatives you might have considered would have been wise, after all. Still, I’m grateful that we were able to find our way to a civilized forum in which to settle our conflict.”\n Janeway crossed her arms over her chest and looked the projection up and down, unimpressed with his immense stature and his casual arrogance.\n “Right.” Hux looked slightly disappointed at the captain’s frosty demeanor, but he just sighed and pushed ahead in a rote tone. “We’re here to adjudicate docket number eight-one-zero-six-six-nine-two, the limited commercial jurisdiction of the Delurididug Trade Hub, subsidiary of the Delurididug Trade Federation, versus Commander Chakotay of the USS Voyager, citizen of the planet Trebus and the United Federation of Planets, provisional officer of Starfleet, regarding alleged acts of industrial espionage, larceny, and use of Trade Hub services to circumvent native legal statutes. The defendant has the right to request an unaffiliated party from the Delurididug Trade Federation to serve as arbiter in this case.” \n Hux turned to address Chakotay directly. “The defendant has elected to waive this right in favor of an expedited hearing, is that correct?”\n Chakotay nodded. If they demanded a living Delurididug arbiter, they’d be waiting an eternity for one to arrive.\n “And how does the defense plea to the aforementioned charges?”\n “Not guilty,” said Captain Janeway.\n Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway.\n Janeway went on, “Let the record reflect that Captain Kathryn Janeway, Commander of the USS Voyager, citizen of Earth and the United Federation of Planets, officer of Starfleet, has chosen to represent her subordinate officer regarding all charges presented by the Trade Hub, per statute nineteen, sub-statute six of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.”\n Hux nodded. “Very well. The defense may now summarize their arguments in support of their plea on behalf of the defendant. Please be brief.”\n Janeway took a deep breath and began to speak. “The original away team, led by Chakotay, arrived at what appeared to be an abandoned space station after passing through a wormhole deep in the unexplored reaches of the Nekrit Expanse. The away team undertook a mission of peaceful exploration, not espionage or piracy, in accordance with my orders. \n “The away team entered the Trade Hub after receiving an automated invitation to dock. The away team received no further guidance or communication from the station after docking, and so they commenced to explore the space station on their own recognizance. They were seeking some means of expediting our trip back to our own civilization, which is situated on the far side of the galaxy. At no point were they provided with the station’s Terms of Service. This is in spite of statute one, sub-statute two, paragraph two of the Terms of Service, which states that the Trade Hub shall provide a complete copy of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service to all guests upon their arrival in Hub Space in a format and a language that the guests can readily interpret.\n “In spite of this lack of guidance, at no point did the away team lie or steal from the station. However, the station appeared to malfunction, inflicting its augmentation technology on my officer against her will. This officer, Ensign Lucille Kang, is the wronged party, not the Trade Hub. Ensign Kang is owed recompense for harm and suffering inflicted by the Trade Hub under statute five, sub-statute one-oh-three of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.”\n Hux absorbed Janeway’s statement with a neutral expression, and when he was certain she was finished, he went on, “At this time, the tribunal will receive all available evidence which is pertinent to this case. The tribunal presents as evidence the operational and security logs of the Trade Hub that were recorded at the time of the alleged misconduct, the subsequent statements of the defendant and the other witnesses, and the Aug-Tech subject Ensign Lucille Kang, which is able to act as a reliable record of the events by virtue of her illegally obtained Aug-Tech implants.\n “If the defense has evidence to submit, now is the time.”\n “The defense presents the complete case history of the Federation High Court,” said Janeway, “as well as the high courts of Alpha Centauri and the United Earth Government, the judgments of the Vulcan High Magistrate, and the precedents established by the Starfleet JAG division relating to genetic augmentation of Starfleet personnel, as requested by the tribunal. The defense also presents the duty and personal log entries made by all members of the away team and myself, from the hours preceding the events in question up until now.”\n Janeway opened the carrying case that hung from her shoulder and took out three isolinear data rods, which she held out for Hux’s inspection.\n “Additionally, the defense petitions the tribunal to abstain from intrusive contact with Ensign Kang under statute seven, sub-statute seventeen of the Trade Hub Terms of Service regarding the treatment of victims of violent crimes.”\n “As the tribunal has not established that Ensign Kang was, in fact, the victim of a crime, it must deny the defense’s petition,” said Hux.\n The data rods floated up, out of Janeway’s hand, momentarily startling the captain. The data rods drifted into the center of the circle, where Hux made a show of scooping them up with one insubstantial hand. Then Lucy felt a sudden weightlessness and found herself floating off of her platform, feet rising behind her until she tilted head-first, eye-level to Hux as she drifted forwards, into the center.\n Lucy looked around at the others, at Janeway’s alarm and Chakotay’s outrage, Harry’s shock, and Owen’s obviously violent intent. He was brandishing his phaser rifle with his right hand, his left tucked into his carrying case as if he were hunting for a second weapon. Crewman Thorold was following his lead, and Tom was watching them like he was considering following suit.\n “Stand down!” Captain Janeway shouted, and Thorold stopped what he was doing and stood at attention.\n Owen didn’t seem to hear her. He pulled what looked to be some kind of modified phase discriminator out of his case and popped open the side compartment of his phaser rifle.\n “Chief Vance, stand down!” Janeway bellowed.\n Owen hesitated. His gaze found Lucy’s, his eyes entreating, as if he were looking to her for a sign that he should ignore the captain’s order. Lucy shook her head.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[8, 19, "PER"], [27, 30, "PER"], [146, 149, "PER"], [157, 161, "PER"], [288, 296, "PER"], [494, 497, "PER"], [655, 659, "PER"], [728, 731, "PER"], [756, 771, "PER"], [856, 859, "PER"], [901, 916, "PER"], [939, 942, "PER"], [1174, 1181, "PER"], [1326, 1329, "PER"], [1366, 1375, "PER"], [1561, 1582, "ORG"], [1602, 1630, "ORG"], [1639, 1657, "PER"], [1665, 1676, "SHIP"], [1700, 1706, "LOC"], [1715, 1743, "GPE"], [1768, 1777, "ORG"], [1847, 1856, "ORG"], [1973, 2001, "ORG"], [2039, 2042, "PER"], [2061, 2069, "PER"], [2180, 2188, "PER"], [2223, 2234, "SPEC"], [2377, 2392, "PER"], [2395, 2398, "PER"], [2423, 2438, "PER"], [2441, 2448, "PER"], [2487, 2510, "PER"], [2512, 2521, "PER"], [2529, 2540, "SHIP"], [2553, 2558, "LOC"], [2567, 2595, "GPE"], [2608, 2617, "ORG"], [2706, 2715, "ORG"], [2762, 2783, "ORG"], [2804, 2807, "PER"], [2946, 2953, "PER"], [3025, 3033, "PER"], [3164, 3178, "LOC"], [3323, 3332, "LOC"], [3675, 3681, "LOC"], [3862, 3871, "ORG"], [3909, 3930, "ORG"], [3984, 3993, "LOC"], [4289, 4308, "PER"], [4340, 4349, "ORG"], [4351, 4362, "PER"], [4422, 4431, "ORG"], [4484, 4505, "ORG"], [4526, 4529, "PER"], [4539, 4548, "PER"], [4812, 4821, "ORG"], [4973, 4992, "PER"], [5220, 5241, "ORG"], [5249, 5256, "PER"], [5358, 5380, "ORG"], [5312, 5335, "ORG"], [5274, 5303, "ORG"], [5420, 5442, "ORG"], [5479, 5488, "ORG"], [5703, 5710, "PER"], [5827, 5832, "PER"], [5935, 5946, "PER"], [5997, 6006, "ORG"], [6122, 6133, "PER"], [6214, 6217, "PER"], [6253, 6262, "PER"], [6363, 6366, "PER"], [6433, 6437, "PER"], [6580, 6583, "PER"], [6627, 6631, "PER"], [6664, 6673, "PER"], [6684, 6694, "PER"], [6704, 6711, "PER"], [6723, 6729, "PER"], [6895, 6910, "PER"], [6939, 6942, "PER"], [7016, 7031, "PER"], [7045, 7052, "PER"], [7104, 7108, "PER"], [7280, 7291, "PER"], [7306, 7313, "PER"], [7325, 7329, "PER"], [7356, 7362, "PER"], [7451, 7460, "PER"], [7468, 7472, "PER"]]}

Then he shrugged. “Right. Where were we?” With that, Hux stretched out his free right hand for Lucy. Lucy raised her own left hand to meet his, and Hux touched his forefinger to hers.\n It didn’t feel like anything. Hux’s form was just empty, insubstantial light; no flesh, not even the simulated force-field flesh of a typical hologram.
