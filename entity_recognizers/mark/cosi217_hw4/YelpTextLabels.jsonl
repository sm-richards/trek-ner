{"id": 305, "text": "Summary: Service and ambiance is very good. Food is good but not great. \n\nWe had the calamari and Thai tiger shrimp to start. Maybe 5-6 calamari rings and 2 tiger shrimps grilled nicely topped with a bed of salad in a sweet balsamic vinegrette dressing, likely to make the dish look more full of food. They also provide warm bread with hummus and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to start. We ordered the seafood risotto and spicy calbrese pizza as entrees. Risotto was good but it was more like a paella rather than what I was expecting for risotto. Pizza was thin and crispy but for some reason a bit tough to cut despite them giving me what resembled a steak knife to cut it up with. What I really liked was their chilli oil. If you like spicy, ask for that. It's apparently made in house (what the server told me). Best part of my meal was their chilli oil. \n\nSince I was just at Basilico restaurant last week, I can easily compare the risotto and pizza to Basilico's. I would say Basilico had better food. BUT, I enjoyed the service at this restaurant. Wait staff don't seem to be assigned to just \"their\" tables. They help each other out and just service your table as needed and as they see fit so you don't wait long for service. Also, food comes out way faster here vs Basilico. Within 5 minutes we had our starter and within 15 minutes of ordering we had our entrees (but maybe it's worth the wait at Basilico since the food was more well prepared). Dessert came in 5 minutes of ordering. \n\nAs for alcoholic drinks, I wouldn't recommend the old fashioned. Missing brown sugar, orange peel, and overall doesn't get close to what a good old fashioned tastes like. TheB-52 coffee was good, though - shot of espresso mixed with Bailey's, Khalua and one other liqueur (escaping my mind at the moment) and topped with whipped cream. \n\nFor dessert, we had the apple and cranberry crumble topped with ice cream. I wouldn't recommend it. It's OK but too much sauce and not enough crumble and I don't even recall tasting much cranberry. \n\nOverall, a good experience and I'd come back since I live in Kleinburg and it's minutes away and located in the Kleinburg Village.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[52, 70, "QUAL"], [85, 93, "DISH"], [98, 115, "DISH"], [136, 150, "INGRED"], [157, 170, "INGRED"], [207, 212, "INGRED"], [218, 252, "INGRED"], [320, 330, "DISH"], [336, 342, "INGRED"], [347, 356, "INGRED"], [361, 377, "INGRED"], [403, 418, "DISH"], [423, 443, "DISH"], [456, 463, "DISH"], [496, 502, "DISH"], [468, 472, "QUAL"], [540, 547, "DISH"], [549, 554, "DISH"], [559, 563, "QUAL"], [568, 574, "QUAL"], [597, 613, "QUAL"], [715, 725, "INGRED"], [848, 858, "INGRED"], [817, 837, "QUAL"], [882, 890, "BIZ"], [938, 945, "DISH"], [950, 955, "DISH"], [959, 969, "BIZ"], [983, 991, "DISH"], [996, 1007, "QUAL"], [1549, 1562, "DISH"], [1572, 1583, "INGRED"], [1564, 1571, "QUAL"], [1585, 1596, "INGRED"], [1531, 1544, "QUAL"], [1614, 1627, "QUAL"], [1643, 1656, "DISH"], [1673, 1684, "DISH"], [1712, 1720, "INGRED"], [1732, 1740, "INGRED"], [1742, 1748, "INGRED"], [1820, 1833, "INGRED"], [1861, 1888, "DISH"], [1901, 1910, "INGRED"], [1919, 1932, "QUAL"], [1942, 1944, "QUAL"], [1949, 1963, "QUAL"], [1968, 1986, "QUAL"]]}

The ice itself is milk flavored, and you have about 5-6 flavours including the classic soybean flavored and matcha. We ordered a large matcha one that came to about $11. It was quite large for 2 people and we were full after finishing that, so I would recommend the smaller one. There was a healthy amount of matcha powder sprinkled on top of the shaved ice, along with some red beans, whipped cream and a scoop of matcha ice cream on top. The bf was very pleased with this shaved ice, saying the flavors were great. It didn't melt very fast which was great since I'm a slower eater. The ice is very finely shaved and it looked like snow.

I was there last Saturday to meet with friends,  catch a show, do some bowling and have dinner. The place was packed with about 200 people all there for a nice night out. \n      I want to say that I appreciate the authenticity of the bowling lanes and the owners not falling to the pressure of modernizing them. It's what makes mahalls special,  you can go anywhere for computer screens and moonrock bowling. It gives you a feel for what bowling was really like in the old days which is pretty cool. \n      Next I wanted to address the food. A friend of mine recommended the fried chicken claiming it was the best in lakewood, which is a high standard to live up to but I must say I was not disappointed.  I also like that they offer a variety of tacos (vegan especially).  It's not often a bowling alley/concert venue offers much more than fries and microwaved soft pretzles.\n      Now with all the things that mahalls offers you can imagine it might be pretty packed on a Saturday night with 2 stages for music,  20 bowling lanes and amazing food. Not to mention an assortment of signature cocktails and an interesting selection of bottled beers and drafts that are not carried everywhere you go. It's nice to put the bud light down for a minute and try something that was made with a little more creativity and care. And for how busy it was i was very impressed with the timelyness of my service and appreciated the zest the bartenders had for serving as many people as they could as fast as they could.\n      I will definitely return soon and often.

Interesting twist to a juice shop.  \n\nOne unique thing they offer here is you can make up your own juice by picking first a base of carrot, apple, cucumber or celery  and then add up to 4 different items of greens and root veggies like beets.  This way you can get total greens with no sugar up to the sweeter fruits and veggies.  I Decided to try there green drink special Vonda's special which was with different greens  but don't remember exactly everything in the drink.  I have yet to try the smoothies but I was told that all cream smoothies can be made with either yogurt or made vegan with coconut cream.  Will need to try one next time.\n\nPrices for juices are between 8-10 buckaroos which is within reason for juice shops these days.

But the food more than makes up for it and the service is superb; a very friendly, accommodating and helpful staff whom are present just enough to fulfill all needs yet not be intrusive.\n\nMy husband and I couldn't decide (or agree!) on an appetizer, as they all looked so good, so we ordered the Ethnic Sampler which gave us a fairly substantial taste of the samosa (fried pastry with spicy vegetable filling), vegetable cutlet (deep fried vegetable patties) and mirchi bajji (deep friend chilies stuffed with chutney), enough for two diners so if there are more people in your party you'll want to order more than one.  My husband preferred the samosas and I the mirchi bajji, but we agreed that all were excellent so it's really a matter of personal taste.\n\nWe usually order our entrees with naan, any of them are good but my favorite is the garlic naan, which is not too greasy but still soft and fragrant and not at all dry.  In the past, we have also ordered the aloo paratha, which I considered a bit less flavorful and more dry than the naan--again, probably personal taste and having to do with the fact that it's made with potatoes. \n\nThe entrees themselves are excellent and so far I haven't had one I haven't liked, but there are two that stand above all the others.  Oddly enough my favorite is a rice dish, Chicken Biryani, which is not necessarily an entree though I order it as one.  The seasoning and spices used are amazing--very unique--it's very spicy with big chunks of high quality, lean chicken and it comes with a mellow yogurt sauce that helps tone down some of the heat.  My second favorite is the Chicken Pepper Fry, again, very spicy with a complex taste and loads of black pepper.  The one thing Tamarind gets right over and over is spiciness!  I've also had the Chicken Vindaloo, Curry and Aloo Gobi Masala, all very good.  \n\nI've always been too full to order dessert so I can't help you out there, though the mango lassi's are wonderful and refreshing.

There were a few booths in the back corner with patrons smoking hookah but it was nearly empty the entire 90+ minutes we were there. There was also some take-out business at the same time. A host led us to a table near the couches/stage area in the back. I immediately noticed that one of the workers (?) was napping on a couch about 10 feet away. \n\nThe music was just something off the laptop of one of the hookah patrons, mostly obscure rap music.\n\nHere's where things got a little weird. We were completely finished eating and the staff was around fixing some other tables (at this point we're still the only dine in patrons), and then they pull some tables together and the entire staff sits down for dinner in the front of the restaurant. We waited another 20-25 minutes for our waitress to come back and ask if we were finished or wanted dessert. The answer was a resounding no.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[26, 33, "SERV"], [132, 145, "QUAL"], [159, 175, "DISH"], [191, 199, "INGRED"], [200, 206, "INGRED"], [207, 212, "INGRED"], [213, 218, "DISH"], [220, 230, "DISH"], [242, 246, "DISH"]]}

I don't know that I've ever seen it called Khaneh Kabob (though perhaps that's what it says in their native tongue).\n\nAnyway - the place is indeed clean, though in an odd twist, it's attached to a beverage store.  That's not bad, just a statement of fact.  If you order a kabob that contains steak or chicken, I can definitely see how you might be disappointed - you don't get a lot.\n\nIf you order a kabob that has ground meat, you'll probably have leftovers.  Unfortunately, I can't tell you which kind to order, because we always go with our friends who do the ordering for us, but I can definitely tell you that these are not your typical Americanized shish-kabobs.  These are Persian-style kabobs.  So don't be disappointed.\n\nThe ground-beef-style ones are wrapped around a long, flat skewer and cooked on the skewer, and you get a ton of meat.  I don't know if you have to order side dishes separately, but we always get them - rice, bread and other items - because the meat by itself is good, but you'll want to have other items as well, because it makes it so much better.\n\nService is friendly, but it isn't speedy, and they have not historically been able to communicate particularly well in English.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[64, 76, "BIZ"], [170, 182, "BIZ"], [324, 332, "DISH"], [399, 404, "DISH"], [494, 509, "QUAL"], [527, 532, "DISH"], [542, 553, "INGRED"], [419, 424, "INGRED"], [428, 435, "INGRED"], [807, 820, "QUAL"], [821, 827, "DISH"], [861, 878, "QUAL"], [963, 974, "QUAL"], [1060, 1064, "DISH"], [1066, 1071, "DISH"], [1102, 1106, "DISH"]]}

{"id": 502, "text": "Very good.  I am part Iranian, so I know my Persian food.  Meat here is cooked perfect...very tender.  Came with a large party once and the owner (who is super nice and accommodating) brought us a sampler of all the meat.   In general, I love to order the ground beef kebabs and lamb kebabs at Persian restaurants and this place doesn't disappoint (I like to add sumac, which is on the table to all the meats and sometimes the rice).\n\nOnly disappointment for me is that they don't have a clay oven to make homemade Persian lavash bread like they do in all the restaurants in Atlanta.  Instead you get pita before your meal.  It comes with onion and feta.  You can ask for mint and eat it with the bread, onion, and feta.  Sounds weird, but that is common in Persian restaurants.\n\nEggplant dip is very good and is a must in any Persian restaurant.  I wish they had more than one eggplant dish, though.  Ice cream is really good.

{"id": 504, "text": "I did not set out to write a bad review.  I have great respect for a small business trying to make their way in the world.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING\n\nPositive:\n\nFood:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.\n\nService:  Initially good\n\nNegative:\n\nPrice: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.\n\nCoupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.\n\nAtmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. \n\nBathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort\n\nWaitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.\n\nExtra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.\n\nKids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.\n\nAir conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.\n\nNote to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.\n\nNote to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[157, 165, "QUAL"], [188, 213, "QUAL"], [350, 354, "SERV"], [677, 681, "SERV"], [1221, 1225, "DISH"], [1230, 1234, "DISH"], [1262, 1268, "INGRED"], [1277, 1281, "DISH"], [1316, 1326, "INGRED"], [1447, 1454, "INGRED"], [1471, 1475, "DISH"], [1501, 1508, "INGRED"], [1524, 1531, "INGRED"], [1869, 1874, "DISH"], [1875, 1881, "INGRED"], [1886, 1897, "INGRED"], [1932, 1937, "DISH"], [2067, 2079, "QUAL"], [2874, 2899, "QUAL"]]}
