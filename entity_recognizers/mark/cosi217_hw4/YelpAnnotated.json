Maybe 5-6 calamari rings and 2 tiger shrimps grilled nicely topped with a bed of salad in a sweet balsamic vinegrette dressing, likely to make the dish look more full of food. They also provide warm bread with hummus and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to start. We ordered the seafood risotto and spicy calbrese pizza as entrees. Risotto was good but it was more like a paella rather than what I was expecting for risotto. Pizza was thin and crispy but for some reason a bit tough to cut despite them giving me what resembled a steak knife to cut it up with. What I really liked was their chilli oil. If you like spicy, ask for that. It's apparently made in house (what the server told me). Best part of my meal was their chilli oil. \n\nSince I was just at Basilico restaurant last week, I can easily compare the risotto and pizza to Basilico's. I would say Basilico had better food. BUT, I enjoyed the service at this restaurant. Wait staff don't seem to be assigned to just \"their\" tables. They help each other out and just service your table as needed and as they see fit so you don't wait long for service. Also, food comes out way faster here vs Basilico. Within 5 minutes we had our starter and within 15 minutes of ordering we had our entrees (but maybe it's worth the wait at Basilico since the food was more well prepared). Dessert came in 5 minutes of ordering. \n\nAs for alcoholic drinks, I wouldn't recommend the old fashioned. Missing brown sugar, orange peel, and overall doesn't get close to what a good old fashioned tastes like. TheB-52 coffee was good, though - shot of espresso mixed with Bailey's, Khalua and one other liqueur (escaping my mind at the moment) and topped with whipped cream. \n\nFor dessert, we had the apple and cranberry crumble topped with ice cream. I wouldn't recommend it. It's OK but too much sauce and not enough crumble and I don't even recall tasting much cranberry. \n\nOverall, a good experience and I'd come back since I live in Kleinburg and it's minutes away and located in the Kleinburg Village.", "annotations": [{"label": 8, "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 70, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 93, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 115, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 150, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 157, "end_offset": 170, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 207, "end_offset": 212, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 218, "end_offset": 252, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 320, "end_offset": 330, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 336, "end_offset": 342, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 347, "end_offset": 356, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 361, "end_offset": 377, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 403, "end_offset": 418, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 423, "end_offset": 443, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 456, "end_offset": 463, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 496, "end_offset": 502, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 468, "end_offset": 472, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 540, "end_offset": 547, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 549, "end_offset": 554, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 559, "end_offset": 563, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 568, "end_offset": 574, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 597, "end_offset": 613, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 715, "end_offset": 725, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 848, "end_offset": 858, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 817, "end_offset": 837, "user": 1}, {"label": 9, "start_offset": 882, "end_offset": 890, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 938, "end_offset": 945, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 950, "end_offset": 955, "user": 1}, {"label": 9, "start_offset": 959, "end_offset": 969, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 983, "end_offset": 991, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 996, "end_offset": 1007, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1549, "end_offset": 1562, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1572, "end_offset": 1583, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1564, "end_offset": 1571, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1585, "end_offset": 1596, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1531, "end_offset": 1544, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1614, "end_offset": 1627, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1643, "end_offset": 1656, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1673, "end_offset": 1684, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1712, "end_offset": 1720, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1732, "end_offset": 1740, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1742, "end_offset": 1748, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1820, "end_offset": 1833, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1861, "end_offset": 1888, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1901, "end_offset": 1910, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1919, "end_offset": 1932, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1942, "end_offset": 1944, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1949, "end_offset": 1963, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1968, "end_offset": 1986, "user": 1}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Ended up calling in the order. My fiancé tells the girl what we would like and she proceeds to tell him that they can't put meatballs in the calzones. He tells her it is on the website and she yells to the manager who just yells back that of course they can. Once we got past the meatballs, he told her our address, and then had to repeat it 5 or 6 times for her to understand, he spelled it, said, said one letter at a time. But this girl just couldn't seem to get it. We gave our payment info and she said okay and bye. No estimated time of delivery, nothing. \n\nWe figured it wouldn't take too long. Simple order and we live a whole 3 miles from the store. Nope. We call them after an hour and get told our order is JUST leaving the store and will be there in 10 minutes. I knew it would be more than 10 minutes but whatever. 30 minutes later it finally shows up.\n\nMy fiancé's calzone was dripping in grease so much that the crust was soggy and the box was too. Mine was the same, but I at least had the paper liner that kept the box from almost falling apart. Both were barely warm, were dripping in grease and were coated in a thick layer of congealed cheese that was disgusting.

I was there last Saturday to meet with friends,  catch a show, do some bowling and have dinner. The place was packed with about 200 people all there for a nice night out. \n      I want to say that I appreciate the authenticity of the bowling lanes and the owners not falling to the pressure of modernizing them. It's what makes mahalls special,  you can go anywhere for computer screens and moonrock bowling. It gives you a feel for what bowling was really like in the old days which is pretty cool. \n      Next I wanted to address the food. A friend of mine recommended the fried chicken claiming it was the best in lakewood, which is a high standard to live up to but I must say I was not disappointed.  I also like that they offer a variety of tacos (vegan especially).  It's not often a bowling alley/concert venue offers much more than fries and microwaved soft pretzles.\n      Now with all the things that mahalls offers you can imagine it might be pretty packed on a Saturday night with 2 stages for music,  20 bowling lanes and amazing food. Not to mention an assortment of signature cocktails and an interesting selection of bottled beers and drafts that are not carried everywhere you go. It's nice to put the bud light down for a minute and try something that was made with a little more creativity and care. And for how busy it was i was very impressed with the timelyness of my service and appreciated the zest the bartenders had for serving as many people as they could as fast as they could.\n      I will definitely return soon and often.

It's very similar to your average juice shop of juices, smoothies, and Brazilian bowls.  Lady taking order was very nice and helpful.  She told me their is a naturopath  adjacent to them that is slightly closed off by a wall.  I forgot the pricing but the lady was not there when I went in the morning hours.  Interesting twist to a juice shop.  \n\nOne unique thing they offer here is you can make up your own juice by picking first a base of carrot, apple, cucumber or celery  and then add up to 4 different items of greens and root veggies like beets.  This way you can get total greens with no sugar up to the sweeter fruits and veggies.  I Decided to try there green drink special Vonda's special which was with different greens  but don't remember exactly everything in the drink.  I have yet to try the smoothies but I was told that all cream smoothies can be made with either yogurt or made vegan with coconut cream.  Will need to try one next time.\n\nPrices for juices are between 8-10 buckaroos which is within reason for juice shops these days.

No overkill here, just a well balanced amount of buttercream.\n- The cake is moist yet fluffy and light, not overly dense, certainly not dry. \n- The flavors rock and there's a lot of variety! The Savannah (classic red velvet) is splendid, the Duracelle (carrot walnut) is delish, the Betsy comes adorned with bits of dark chocolate, and hi, they have nutella filled cupcakes! Nut kidding! Their dark chocolate cakes pass my high standards, and I really can walk away from this place feeling great. \n\nNow I need to go back for their thirsty thursday specials, yes, it's what you think, liquor laced cupcakes. What a fantastic idea. \n\nBlushing has really perfected the art of making a cupcake and it's a great mood booster to have a well-made cupcake.

Now that's a true Aroma customer. \n\nI enjoy their orchid latte which should really be called orchid pudding because that is what it is. It's an especially nice hot sweet treat in the winter and feels like a warm blanket hugging you from the inside, mmmm! The nuts and spices add a very nice touch.\n\nTheir cheese danishes are among the best I have had in Toronto and unlike most cheese danishes I come across, these actually taste like the real deal. I am told their pastries are shipped frozen and then \"baked\" in store so I am curious about who really makes them.

A flauta is a tortilla wrapped around a meat and cheese and then deep fried.  They give you a choice of flour or wheat tortilla - you get 6 pieces of the flautas that fill up the rim/edge of your plate (3 full flautas cut in half).  It doesn't end there - You get many fixings that you can pick/choose from (onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, guacamole, etc.) All of these fixings are located in the center of you plate.

{"id": 458, "text": "The best Indian food I've ever had hands down, and I've had it all around the world at varying price ranges.  The restaurant itself is located in an old mansion, yet the atmosphere is a little lacking as it's on the dark side and lacking in unifying decor.  But the food more than makes up for it and the service is superb; a very friendly, accommodating and helpful staff whom are present just enough to fulfill all needs yet not be intrusive.\n\nMy husband and I couldn't decide (or agree!) on an appetizer, as they all looked so good, so we ordered the Ethnic Sampler which gave us a fairly substantial taste of the samosa (fried pastry with spicy vegetable filling), vegetable cutlet (deep fried vegetable patties) and mirchi bajji (deep friend chilies stuffed with chutney), enough for two diners so if there are more people in your party you'll want to order more than one.  My husband preferred the samosas and I the mirchi bajji, but we agreed that all were excellent so it's really a matter of personal taste.\n\nWe usually order our entrees with naan, any of them are good but my favorite is the garlic naan, which is not too greasy but still soft and fragrant and not at all dry.  In the past, we have also ordered the aloo paratha, which I considered a bit less flavorful and more dry than the naan--again, probably personal taste and having to do with the fact that it's made with potatoes. \n\nThe entrees themselves are excellent and so far I haven't had one I haven't liked, but there are two that stand above all the others.  Oddly enough my favorite is a rice dish, Chicken Biryani, which is not necessarily an entree though I order it as one.  The seasoning and spices used are amazing--very unique--it's very spicy with big chunks of high quality, lean chicken and it comes with a mellow yogurt sauce that helps tone down some of the heat.  My second favorite is the Chicken Pepper Fry, again, very spicy with a complex taste and loads of black pepper.  The one thing Tamarind gets right over and over is spiciness!  I've also had the Chicken Vindaloo, Curry and Aloo Gobi Masala, all very good.  \n\nI've always been too full to order dessert so I can't help you out there, though the mango lassi's are wonderful and refreshing.  I always finish mine up with the appetizer and wish I had more later on.\n\nAlso of note, there's a Dinner for Two Sunday night special that is a phenomenal deal; $25 gets you an appetizer, a bread and two entrees, which is more than enough for two diners.  There are only a few restrictions which are listed clearly in the menu.  Tuesday night is Dosa Night, order one get the second 50% off, and Wednesday night is Student Night, order one entree get the second 50% off, with appropriate student ID.", "annotations": [{"label": 8, "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 271, "end_offset": 289, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 554, "end_offset": 568, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 617, "end_offset": 623, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 669, "end_offset": 685, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 625, "end_offset": 637, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 643, "end_offset": 666, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 687, "end_offset": 715, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 721, "end_offset": 733, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 735, "end_offset": 754, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 768, "end_offset": 775, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 904, "end_offset": 911, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 922, "end_offset": 934, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 955, "end_offset": 973, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1052, "end_offset": 1056, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1102, "end_offset": 1113, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1124, "end_offset": 1138, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1143, "end_offset": 1166, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1171, "end_offset": 1185, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1226, "end_offset": 1238, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1261, "end_offset": 1279, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1284, "end_offset": 1292, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1302, "end_offset": 1306, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1390, "end_offset": 1398, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1429, "end_offset": 1438, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1553, "end_offset": 1561, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1567, "end_offset": 1576, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1578, "end_offset": 1593, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1661, "end_offset": 1681, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1691, "end_offset": 1698, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1718, "end_offset": 1728, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1748, "end_offset": 1760, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1767, "end_offset": 1774, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1762, "end_offset": 1766, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1795, "end_offset": 1814, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 1881, "end_offset": 1899, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1908, "end_offset": 1918, "user": 1}, {"label": 8, "start_offset": 1926, "end_offset": 1939, "user": 1}, {"label": 7, "start_offset": 1953, "end_offset": 1965, "user": 1}, {"label": 9, "start_offset": 1982, "end_offset": 1990, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 2049, "end_offset": 2065, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 2067, "end_offset": 2093, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 2198, "end_offset": 2209, "user": 1}, {"label": 6, "start_offset": 2433, "end_offset": 2438, "user": 1}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

When it came to collecting Scene points, the waitress claimed that only 1 person could collect at our table of 20, even though we each paid individually. Secondly, when it came to redeeming Scene points, they were unable to do so. It was not until we spoke to the manager that they said we could still redeem the points, but it would take a while longer to create individual bills. We had been at Milestones for nearly 3 hours at that point and just wanted to leave and get on with our day, and so we elected to just pay for our meals without redeeming our Scene points.\n\nThe chaos that ensued from the simple request of collecting and redeeming Scene points - a program that's been in existence for at least 5 years - is unacceptable.\n\nTo make matters worse, the waitresses and manager handled the situation in an unprofessional manner.

PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING\n\nPositive:\n\nFood:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.\n\nService:  Initially good\n\nNegative:\n\nPrice: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.\n\nCoupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.\n\nAtmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. \n\nBathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort\n\nWaitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.\n\nExtra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.\n\nKids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.\n\nAir conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.\n\nNote to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.\n\nNote to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.
