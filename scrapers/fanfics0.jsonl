{"text": "=============================================================== Chapter One \u201cCaptain\u2019s log, stardate 48039.5 We are proceeding to starbase 141 for repairs and refits, as well as some minor changes in the crew. Since the plans to add a new weapon to Galaxy class starships have been cancelled when we found out that the Borg are no longer a threat, we are not expecting any major changes. The crew is scheduled for shore leave in the starbase\u2019s recreational areas. After our recent strenuous missions, it will be a welcome change.\u201d Though he would never admit it to the crew, Picard was looking forward to the leave, and hoped it wouldn\u2019t be cancelled like their last promised off- time. Granted, their mission to explore the anomaly in the Romulan Neutral Zone had been important and urgent, but how many more urgent events could wait for his ship and crew? His old friend and Academy roommate in the first year, Admiral S\u2019trel, was in command of starbase 141. It would be good to see him again. He stood up, and pulled his uniform jacket down. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my ready room. Number One, you have the bridge.\u201d They were in the middle of Federation space. He would probably not be needed on the bridge until they arrived at the starbase. It would give him an opportunity to practice saying \u201cSShSrsreowSrtSskr SsS KRkRst\u201d, the Setallian greeting \u2013 back in the Academy, S\u2019trel had always bugged Picard about not being able to give a proper welcome. The Setallian language, like the languages of most other sentient cat-like beings, was extremely hard to learn for humanoids. It had 42 different \u201cs\u201d sounds, and only two vowels. With the genaral availability of universal translators, the need to learn foreign languages had gone, but there were some things that could be expressed in other languages better than in Federation standard, and Picard had tried to know the basics of all important languages spoken in the Federation. While Picard practised, Data reviewed the results of the latest cybernetics conferences. Commander Maddox still served on starbase 141, and it would be a good opportunity to discuss android construction \u2013 procreation, he thought \u2013 with another expert. Riker sat in the captain\u2019s chair without anything special to do \u2013 he knew what he\u2019d do on the starbase, and it didn\u2019t require preparation. Starbase 141 had been equipped with the latest holodeck technology, and after the Bynars had shown him what holodecks might be able to do, he didn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to check out improved holodecks. \u201cEstimated time of arrival, Ensign Seron?\u201d, he asked. The Vulcan navigator replied, without looking up from his console, \u201cAt the current speed, without further delays, we will arrive at starbase 141 in fifty-nine minutes.\u201d Seron\u2019s mentioning of fifty-nine minutes reminded Riker of Data\u2019s early days, and remembered his insistance on seconds whenever mentioning a time. He wondered if the Vulcan was just more inaccurate than an android, or whether he had just asked fifty-nine minutes and zero seconds before they would arrive. One more hour\u2026 Riker was tempted to let Data have the bridge, or to order Seron to increase speed, but he couldn\u2019t find a professional excuse. The hour passed \u2013 extremely slowly, Riker thought \u2013 and the Enterprise"}
{"text": "  Q-Logy By Jeff Stoneking CHAPTER ONE So this was what it was like to be dead?  Consciousness dissipating as the void all around stretches endlessly and no escape is in sight, and an unsettling feeling that there may be no God after all?  Or perhaps there was a God, a single Creator who had deemed that the entity was destined to spend the rest of eternity separated from Him.  Maybe this was a transitional phase in reincarnation, or perhaps the mythical place commonly referred to as purgatory by corporeal life forms.  Being dead for the first time, and seeing that none other of his species had experienced death, the entity didn\u2019t really know what to expect, though various books, religious and secular, had postulated theories throughout the millennia.  For all he knew, the entity would just as well end up in Heaven or Hell, Sto\u2019vo\u2019kor or Gre\u2019thor, or in the Divine Treasury or the Vault of Eternal Destitution, or simply no where at all.  After all, being part of a species that never died, would any of those places welcome him willingly?  He once was a God, so what God would want him to spend eternity with Him? \u201cI think,\u201d the entity thought, recalling that was the tell tale sign of being simply a being.  However, the thought took no substance, and seemed to touch nothing in time.  The entity was pulled out of all that was called home, all that was called familiar.  The entity thought, but only unto itself.  \u201cI think yet I think not; I think not and I am dead.\u201d With this thought, there was no substance, no root of any kind or reality.  The entity reached out beyond itself into the deep reaches of the cosmos.  If there was an afterlife, the entity was determined to find it.  Unfortunately, nothing answered back.  For the entity\u2019s entire life, there had been a multitudinous array of voices in his head.  The entity had been part of a great societal experiment, never being alone, never being without reach of the arms of comrades or beyond the grasp of their words.  Now the entity was all alone, thinking what might have been the last thought.  Why was the entity being punished so horribly?  Was the execution?  Excommunication?  The entity forgot the details that lead up to this horrific solitude.  There was the vibrancy of life, the wonderment of it all, then nothing.  Emptiness, space, and silence. Would these be the companions of the entity though the rest of eternity?  The entity always wanted to live forever, and kept on telling others that it would live forever, but now the thought of a true eternity terrified the entity.  The entity cried, and it cried out to whoever might listen, but would anybody hear? Guinan, off duty and soaking in the beauty of the arboretum, noticed something slightly awry.  She gazed over at Keiko O\u2019Brien, who was fixing her attention on planting seeds she received from Forchin.  Keiko had complained about the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables aboard the Enterprise, stating that replicator technology had a far way to go.  As she was planting yet another seed, her eyes lost their lock on her work and she looked up at Guinan.  There was something awry. \u201cGuinan,\u201d Keiko started, \u201cwhat brings you up here? Guinan had entered the arboretum after Keiko and, apparently, Guinan had not noticed Keiko, as her concentration seemed to be broken slightly with Keiko\u2019s question.  \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful up here,\u201d Guinan replied with a smile.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of those few places one can go on the ship and forget that you are in space.  It\u2019s a nice retreat.\u201d \u201cI suppose so,\u201d smiled Keiko.  \u201cYou must be reminded all the time you are in space working in Ten-Forward.  Of course, there always is the holodeck.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t go into the holodeck much unless Jean Luc or somebody else might invite me along for an adventure.  I prefer to relax in more realistic settings,\u201d Guinan replied. There was something awry.  Keiko could sense unease in Guinan, as if she was making small talk but there was something charging through her mind at that moment that caused her to be detached from the present.  She felt Guinan had not simply come to the arboretum to be away from the feeling of being on a star ship, but something was preoccupying her, and even though Guinan replied to all of Keiko\u2019s comments, Keiko still felt as if Guinan was not even talking to anybody in particular, really.  Guinan could not even keep in eye contact with Keiko and were in constant gaze out the windows.  Keiko turned her head up and looked out the window.  It was simply a star field, an odd choice for somebody to focus on when they just claimed they wanted to get away from the feeling of being in space.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Keiko asked, hoping to get responses out of Guinan that were perhaps more truthful. \u201cI don\u2019t know.  We\u2019re on route to Wadi Besor,\u201d Guinan replied, \u201cbut I feel as if we shouldn\u2019t go.  I felt something earlier, a disturbance of some sort.  I can\u2019t describe it entirely, nor even understand it myself.\u201d Keiko nodded.  She could not describe in concrete language either, but she sensed something was unusual, as if things were not the same anymore.  \u201cSomething is happening but I don\u2019t know what.  From what I\u2019ve seen, everything appears to be status quo.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Guinan nodded.  \u201cStatus quo.  That\u2019s what they want us to think, anyway.\u201d Keiko did not know what to say to that, or how to even how to think she should take it.  At that moment, Miles O\u2019Brien came over Keiko\u2019s com badge, \u201cKeiko, I can\u2019t get off of duty right now to get Molly from the day care.  Do you think you could get her now?\u201d \u201cSure thing, Miles,\u201d Keiko replied, relieved that she had a chance to get away from Guinan.  \u201cSorry, Guinan, but I have to go,\u201d Keiko said awkwardly as she excused herself. Guinan just nodded as if she was unattached from the moment.  As Keiko took her leave of the arboretum, Guinan simply continued to watch out the window as if looking for something, or perhaps expecting something. It was not first in the arboretum that Guinan felt this way, however.  It first occurred to her moments after she left Ten Forward, as she walked down the halls of the Enterprise.  Every curve of the corridors, the nuance of each computer console, down to the locations of the Jefferies Tubes caused an odd sensation to course through Guinan\u2019s being.  Yet, all was the same as it has always been. \u201cComputer,\u201d Guinan said with hesitation in the arboretum, not sure what to expect, \u201cwhat ship is this?\u201d \u201cThis is the USS Enterprise,\u201d the computer spoke back, \u201cregistry number NCC-1701-D.\u201d That is exactly what Guinan thought she would hear, yet she almost expected to hear something else.  \u201cThat,\u201d she said softly and slowly through her lips, \u201cis not right.\u201d  She paused with unease, worry, and confusion forming in her brow and then said, \u201cComputer, locate Captain Picard.\u201d \u201cCaptain Picard is deceased,\u201d the computer responded as if giving a weather report.  \u201cDate of death: stardate 44741.9.\u201d Guinan leaned up against the nearest wall and the words of the computer had barely penetrated her mind and her thoughts.  Something more ominous seemed to emanate from somewhere outside the ship, something she felt and heard all around her, inside her.  It was coming closer, though she could not yet see it.  Out there, beyond the blackness of space, something was coming and it felt terrible. \u201cMiles!\u201d Keiko called out down the corridor.  He was walking out of the transporter room, apparently just getting off duty.  Keiko had Molly in her arms as she quickened her pace to meet up with her husband.  \u201cI was just with Guinan in the arboretum.  She is acting awfully strange.\u201d Miles chuckled, \u201cAs if that\u2019s a surprise?\u201d \u201cSeriously, Miles!\u201d Keiko continued.  \u201cI know she can be rather eccentric, but she really has me concerned.  She really seemed to be concerned about our recent mission to Wadi Besor and\u00c9\u201d \u201cWait a minute?\u201d Miles interrupted.  \u201cHow does she know about that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Keiko replied.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think I should even ask.  What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d \u201cWell, our destinations aren\u2019t usually broadcast over the ship,\u201d Miles replied, \u201cand this destination has been kept quiet among the senior crew.\u201d \u201cWhy?  What\u2019s on Wadi Besor?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the home world of the Taecate,\u201d Miles answered.  \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why we are going there, but I do know that Captain Tutizi was stationed there on the Federation outpost there, and that he and the Captain were good friends.\u201d \u201cCaptain Tutizi?\u201d echoed Keiko.  \u201cWasn\u2019t he murdered?\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d Miles affirmed, \u201cand as far as I know, his killer is still at large, which is why our trip to Wadi Besor isn\u2019t being made public for the time being, in the event the murderer is on board the ship.  The security team is still investigating the potential that the killer may be on board.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s absurd,\u201d Keiko said.  \u201cThe Enterprise was nowhere near Wadi Besor at the time of Tutizi\u2019s death.\u201d \u201cThey are just keeping the possibility open, Keiko,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d insisted Keiko.  \u201cIt makes no sense to mark the Enterprise crew as a ship of suspects.  What about all the other ships in Starfleet?\u201d \u201cTo tell the truth, Keiko, I am not entirely sure of all the ins and outs of this investigation.  What little I do know came from the official channels, which I can assure you.  Nobody is being charged as a suspect yet.  Nevertheless, that\u2019s all beside the point.  I still cannot understand how Guinan knows we are going there.  Unless\u00c9\u201d \u201cMiles, don\u2019t trail off like that.  You know I hate when you do that.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I helped out in stellar spectroscopy earlier today.  Commander Data and I were investigating an anomaly recently located near Wadi Besor.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of anomaly?\u201d Keiko asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Miles said.  \u201cBut I did see something like it before on one of our missions, I am almost certain of that.\u201d \u201cAnd what are you doing helping Data?  You\u2019re not a science officer,\u201d Keiko wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s just stellar spectroscopy,\u201d Miles replied.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty elementary stuff, really, and besides, I think it could help me in that promotion I am gunning for at Deep Space Nine.  It never hurts to broaden your horizons, so they say.  As a matter of fact, I am scheduled to go on duty in stellar spectroscopy in an hour.\u201d \u201cBut you just got off of duty!\u201d Keiko countered. \u201cI might have to pull a few double shifts in the next few weeks,\u201d O\u2019Brien mentioned.  \u201cSorry, but this training for my promotion at Deep Space Nine is killing me too.  I am sure once we get to Deep Space Nine, we will have much more time to ourselves.\u201d CHAPTER TWO The entity searched through the expanse of nothingness.  Searching for something, perhaps another dead soul wandering though this\u2026this limbo?  The entity did not know what it was.  The blackness stretched seemingly from east to west, with no end in sight.  No throne, no God, no Prophets or wormhole aliens, no vaults or hordes of honored Klingons within any imaginable grasp within this void, not even an angel or a lesser deity made by humanoid hands.  No light, no door, no escape; the entity just drifted through nothing, and with each passing moment grew more weary and more depressed.  Where were the parties?  The fanfare music?  The singing choirs of seraphim?  The hordes of welcoming and willing virgins?  The entity began to question exactly where the eternal resting place would be."}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 3 \u201cShe\u2019s stable,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Chakotay, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad?\u201d They stood in the Doctor\u2019s office in sickbay, looking out the window at Ensign Kang where she lay on a sickbay bed, still unconscious. Kes was sitting at her bedside watching the biomonitor. \u201cIt appears the ensign has undergone some rather extensive modifications,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cIn fact, it seems the modification process is ongoing. I have no way to stop it without doing potentially fatal harm to the patient.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of modifications? To what end?\u201d said Chakotay. The Doctor shook his head. \u201cTo what end, I can\u2019t say. It seems a number of biosynthetic implants have been embedded deep in her tissues.\u201d He turned to his desktop console and called up the results of his medical scans, superimposing the readings over a simple outline diagram of a human body. Lit up at multiple points on the diagram were silhouettes of slender little squid-like creatures, or machines\u2026 It was hard to classify the biosynthetic constructs one way or the other. They had heads like worms and many, many tendrils like threads that fanned out through her body.  \u201cThey seem to be hardwired into her nervous system,\u201d the Doctor went on, \u201csending and receiving signals from her central nervous system. They\u2019re supplementing natural organ functions and regulating hormone levels, stimulating the growth of some cells and inhibiting others. They also seem to be modifying her DNA.\u201d Chakotay studied the diagram and the accompanying readings, a sense of disgust and trepidation rising up in him. \u201cThis resembles Borg technology. Is there any evidence of nanoprobes at work here?\u201d The desiccated corpse of a Borg drone he\u2019d stumbled upon on an away mission last week was still fresh in his mind. The specter of Borg cubes lurking just outside of sensor range in the murky depths of the Nekrid Expanse had haunted him ever since. \u201cCertainly not any of Borg design,\u201d said the Doctor, alleviating his fears but not quashing them completely. \u201cMy tests are ongoing, though.\u201d Chakotay studied the diagram closer. \u201cWhat do you make of this one?\u201d he said, pointing at the alien construct occupying the diagram\u2019s skull. \u201cThat implant is the one that worries me the most,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cIts processes are threaded throughout her brain. It might influence her cognition and her perceptions, bias her behavior\u2026 it could conceivably even be controlling her body. I\u2019ll monitor her engrams for any irregularities when she wakes.\u201d Chakotay was quiet for a moment, regarding his unconscious officer. He\u2019d let her down, back on that space station. He hadn\u2019t acted fast enough when that pod had opened. He should have destroyed the thing the moment it made a sound. He should have acted faster when the cables ensnared Ensign Kang. If only he\u2019d been faster, sharper, quicker on his feet\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t let her down now. The alien space station still had her, even if she was out of the pod. He had to find a way to stop its progress before it finished turning her into\u2026 whatever it was turning her into. But, he couldn\u2019t let himself forget, he also had a duty to protect the rest of the crew. He tapped his combadge. \u201cChakotay to Tuvok,\u201d he said. \u201cTuvok here, sir.\u201d \u201cAssign two security personnel to sickbay. The Doctor will brief them when they arrive.\u201d \u201cAcknowledged,\u201d said Tuvok. Chakotay met the Doctor\u2019s gaze, and the Doctor nodded his understanding. \u201cUnder alien control or not, our crewmember is still in there, Doctor,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cI know you\u2019ll do everything in your power to help her.\u201d \u201cOf course, sir,\u201d said the Doctor. Chakotay walked out of the Doctor\u2019s office and crossed sickbay. The doors to the corridor opened as he approached, and standing outside was Chief Vance, looking very dour. That was fast, thought Chakotay. But then he noticed that the security officer wasn\u2019t approaching the door, but apparently dithering in the corridor. \u201cIs there something I can help you with, Chief?\u201d said Chakotay. Vance jumped to attention at the sight of his senior officer. \u201cNo, sir. I just wanted to know if I could visit the patient.\u201d Chakotay felt his eyebrow rising and quickly schooled his facial expression. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the Doctor,\u201d he said, and then he passed out into the corridor.   \u201c\u2026told her how you felt, before?\u201d It was a gentle, feminine voice. Lucy was sure she recognized it. \u201cYes\u2026 well\u2026 I mean, I think she has the general idea,\u201d said someone else. It was a man\u2019s voice, low and brash, and the connotations of his tenor stirred a sense of attraction, balanced on a knife\u2019s edge with a sense of discomfort. Owen, that was the second one. And the first one was Kes, Lucy remembered now. Off to Lucy\u2019s right, something started beeping. It sounded like a sickbay biomonitor. \u201cDoctor!\u201d Kes called, and then she leaned in close to Lucy. \u201cEnsign, are you awake?\u201d Lucy opened her eyes and took in the faces around her. Owen stood on her left, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Kes sat on her right, holding Lucy\u2019s hand. A couple other security officers stood guard by the sickbay doors. The Doctor was approaching from his office, his face a mask of concern. \u201cEnsign?\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Lucy took stock of herself for a moment. The sickbay bed she was lying on was comfortable. The sickbay blanket felt nice on her skin. \u201cI feel alright,\u201d she said. She propped herself up on her elbows, and as her weight shifted, she noticed something about her body was\u2026 off. She couldn\u2019t immediately pin down what it was, though. The Doctor took a medical tricorder off a nearby shelf and began scanning her. Without lifting his eyes from the device, he tapped his badge and said, \u201cDoctor to the Bridge.\u201d \u201cJaneway here, Doctor,\u201d came the captain\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s your status?\u201d \u201cEnsign Kang is awake, sir.\u201d \u201cAcknowledged, Doctor. Thank you.\u201d The Doctor stopped scanning and looked back at his patient. \u201cAre you in any pain?\u201d he said. Lucy shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d The Doctor\u2019s concerned expression didn\u2019t waver. \u201cDo you know where you are right now, Ensign?\u201d Lucy chuckled a little at the question. \u201cSickbay. Voyager. The Delta Quadrant.\u201d The Doctor bit his lip for a moment and said, \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re in sickbay, Ensign Kang?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026\u201d said Lucy, and she glanced around at the others gathered around her bed. The intensity with which the Doctor, Kes and Owen were all looking at her was starting to make her a little bit uncomfortable. The security officers at the door to sickbay were troubling, as well. She returned her attention to the Doctor. \u201cI mean after what happened on the space station\u2026\u201d she cast a meaningful glance at Owen. It had been an intense ordeal, and Owen, at least, would know a bit about what she\u2019d been through. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a surprise.\u201d The Doctor nodded. He still looked worried. Lucy wondered why. She was fine, now. She felt fine. Did he know something she didn\u2019t? The Doctor turned to Owen. \u201cMr. Vance, I\u2019m sorry, but could you excuse us, please?\u201d Owen nodded. \u201cOf course, Doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re alright,\u201d he told Lucy."}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 5 \u201cHere we go again,\u201d said Tom. He was seated on Chakotay\u2019s left, in the pilot seat of the shuttlecraft. Tuvok, Torres, and Kim filled out the rest of the party.  Ahead of the shuttle, the violet eye of the wormhole loomed large. Chakotay found that the experience of having passed through the aperture twice already wasn\u2019t helping his stomach. His guts knew exactly what to expect, and it prepared for the ride by thrashing around inside of him well in advance. Chakotay cast a quick glance over his shoulder at the other three occupants of the shuttlecraft. Ensign Kim in the back looked about as green as Chakotay felt. Tuvok looked positively bored, as usual for the Vulcan. Torres was eyeing the wormhole with unwary fascination. She was obviously not prepared for the rough road that lay ahead. Chakotay caught her eye and flashed her an enigmatic smile that she clearly couldn\u2019t interpret, and then they passed into the wormhole. A slight shimmy rattled through the spaceframe of the shuttlecraft, and then they were out on the other side. That was it. No sudden jolt to the inertial dampeners, and no abrupt torque on the shuttle\u2019s nose cone, either. \u201cWhat, that was it?\u201d said Torres. \u201cI was expecting\u2026\u201d She shrugged. Chakotay gave Lieutenant Paris a questioning look. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, sir,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI only wish I could take the credit.\u201d Ensign Kim consulted his console. \u201cVariances inside of the wormhole were down in the two millicochrane range,\u201d he said. \u201cTelemetry suggests the wormhole spontaneously stabilized in the last seconds before we made the passage.\u201d \u201cAnd now, the wormhole is returning to its previous degree of instability,\u201d Tuvok reported, consulting his own console. \u201cIt would appear that some external force acted momentarily to ensure our safe passage.\u201d As Chakotay considered that bit of information, Ensign Kim ran more scans of the space surrounding the abandoned station. Lieutenant Torres tore her attention from the stunning view outside with an effort and turned her attention to her own console. \u201cThe power output of the station is roughly twice what it was the last time we were here, Commander,\u201d said Ensign Kim. \u201cAt least,\u201d Torres added. \u201cAnd the power seems more stable and distributed around the station than what the telemetry from your last mission recorded.\u201d \u201cI guess the station\u2019s been doing some straightening up since our last visit,\u201d said Chakotay. He was just considering hailing the station again when his communications board lit up.  A tone sounded from Ensign Kim\u2019s ops console, and he announced, \u201cCommander, we\u2019re being hailed.\u201d \u201cI see that, Ensign,\u201d said Chakotay, and he opened a channel with the press of a button. Lieutenant Paris said, \u201cCommander, are you sure that\u2019s such a good idea?\u201d but it was already done. Chakotay just regarded Tom with a cocked eyebrow and a slight shrug. \u201cWelcome, returning customers!\u201d The voice of the station resembled the voice from the last visit in inflection and tone only. Where before it had been grating and artificial, it now sounded as clear and natural as organic speech. It went on, \u201cYou\u2019ve reached the Delurididug Deep Space Travel Network and Trade Hub. Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Travel Network is currently unavailable. However, the Trade Hub is open for business! We are currently transmitting your instructions for docking.\u201d Chakotay\u2019s console received a packet of data from the station, which the computer was able to compile into a simple, graphically represented set of docking instructions. The voice from the station continued talking without pause. \u201cPlease be patient while those ships in queue ahead of yours finish their approaches and departures. Visitors will be cleared to dock in the same order that they arrived through the gateways.\u201d Chakotay glanced around the empty space around the station and exchanged a look with Lieutenant Paris. Tom shook his head. No one else was out there. The automated voice went on, \u201cAll forms of faster-than-light travel and remote matter transference are prohibited inside of Hub Space. Any unwarranted act of violence or aggression against the Hub, the Network, the proprietors of the Hub, or other visitors to the Hub or Network is also prohibited. All contracts joined in good faith within the confines of Hub Space are binding. The Hub and its licensed proprietors reserve the right to withhold service from any customer for any reason. The Hub and the Network are committed to upholding the laws of the Delurididug Trade Federation, as well as the laws specific to the nationalities of each customer, subject to the limits of Trade Federation Law. The Delurididug Trade Hub is empowered by the Delurididug Trade Federation to enforce all binding contracts within the limits of Trade Federation law. Violations of binding contracts are subject to summary arbitration, and may result in confiscation of trade goods or formally recognized legal tender, expulsion from Hub Space, arrest pending trial in a Trade Federation Tribunal, or any combination of the above, subject to the judgment of the administration of the Trade Hub and within the limits of Trade Federation Law. \u201cFor more on the rules, regulations, and policies governing the Trade Hub Station and its surrounding space, please refer to the terms of service that are being transmitted now.\u201d Chakotay studied his console as the computer received another data packet and compiled it into an encyclopedia-sized volume of alien legalese. \u201cTuvok, I\u2019m sending you their rulebook. See if there\u2019s anything in the rules about restricted areas. Maybe we can narrow down the possible locations of the computer core or their power generators, based on where they don\u2019t want us to go. And while you\u2019re at it, see if there\u2019s a procedure in place for filing complaints.\u201d \u201cAye, sir,\u201d said Tuvok. \u201cRespectfully, sir,\u201d said Paris, \u201cDo you really think there\u2019s someone over there that handles complaints?\u201d Chakotay shrugged. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the capabilities of the station, especially now that it\u2019s regained so much function. But it\u2019s clearly highly automated, and it seems to put a lot of value in laws and contracts. We might be able to use that to learn more about what\u2019s happening to Ensign Kang, and hopefully, how to reverse it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not seriously counting on that station to respect Federation laws, are you?\u201d said Torres. \u201cOur Federation, that is.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not counting on anything, Lieutenant,\u201d said Chakotay, \u201cJust exploring all options.\u201d Harry shook his head, but he didn\u2019t look up from his console. \u201cSomething the matter, Ensign?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Harry. \u201cJust\u2026 I keep thinking about Neelix\u2019s ghost story.\u201d Chakotay\u2019s reply was interrupted by the voice of the station. \u201cThank you for your patience. Your vessel has been cleared to dock. We are sending you an updated flight plan to guide you to your berth. Any deviation from the flight plan is grounds to revoke your boarding privileges and move your vessel to the back of the queue. Repeated or flagrant violations may lead to expulsion from Hub Space. \u201cIf you prefer, you may turn over guidance to the Trade Hub guidance system, and we will guide your vessel into its berth.\u201d \u201cFat chance,\u201d Tom remarked. Chakotay\u2019s console received the flight plan, and he sent it over to Tom. \u201cJust stick to the flight plan, Tom. I\u2019d hate to have to wait in that line again,\u201d he deadpanned. Tom gave Chakotay a quizzical glance, and Chakotay favored him with a slight smile.  With a smirk, Tom turned his attention back to his console and punched a series of instructions into the shuttle\u2019s guidance system. \u201cAye, sir. Course laid in and plotted.\u201d \u201cTake us in,\u201d said Chakotay.      They entered the station through the same port as on their previous visit. Inside the bay, conditions had changed markedly. The atmosphere and gravity were the same, but the illumination had increased significantly, owing to an array of free-floating orbs of yellow-white light that hovered over the shuttle bay like little Suns, giving the space an inviting, almost Earth-like quality. Tom set the shuttle down exactly where the flight plan indicated and ran quickly through his power-down checklist while the rest of the crew gave their reports on the station. When they were ready, Tuvok opened the shuttle door. And he froze in the doorway."}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 6 \u201cZut! That test was absolute merde!\u201d said Lucy. She was still enjoying her newfound grasp of twentieth-century French. She\u2019d studied Vulcan and Tellar languages in the Academy just to meet the core requirements, but she never really had a good head for languages. And besides, the universal translator was simply too convenient of a shortcut to even bother. She would have been hard pressed, these days, to recall even the more salient Tellarite curse words. But now, French invectives were free-flowing. \u201cWhoever wrote that program can br\u00fble en l\u2019enfer! And what are you laughing at, Owen?\u201d She whirled about on the security officer who was escorting her back to sickbay. Owen pinched his lips tight, trying to hide his mirth and failing. The other security officer, Crewman DeVries, subtly distanced himself from Owen, leaving him to bear the brunt of Lucy\u2019s wrath. \u201cIs it funny to you, that the Doctor is going to judge my fitness as a Starfleet officer on the outcome of a badly written holodeck melodrama?\u201d After a promising start, the atmospheric Roma carnival setting had dissolved into chaos. A series of contrived plot twists revealed that half the food vendors were actually terrorists. They locked down the fairgrounds and rounded up as many hostages as they could get their hands on. Of course, the task of rescuing everyone fell almost immediately on Lucy. There was never a satisfactory reason given for this. She was simply a stranger in their midst that everyone decided to turn to for leadership.  By this point, Lucy strongly suspected that someone had taken a beautifully crafted holodeck worldspace and overwritten it with the plot of a haphazard, clich\u00e9d action/adventure novel. Owen shook his head. \u201cNo. You\u2019re right. The Doctor\u2019s program was\u2026 merde.\u201d He struggled and failed to hold in a smile. \u201cThen what\u2019s so funny?\u201d Lucy shouted. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Owen. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 nice to see you getting angry.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Lucy. She shook her head in bewilderment. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cJust\u2026\u201d Owen cast a glance at Bobby DeVries, and lowered his voice to near-inaudibility. \u201cSince what happened\u2026 You haven\u2019t once gotten upset about anything.\u201d Lucy blinked. \u201cSo what?\u201d \u201cSo it was a really upsetting thing that happened!\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in denial about it or what, but\u2026\u201d DeVries cleared his throat, bringing Owen up short. \u201cSorry,\u201d said Owen, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk about that. Let\u2019s just get back to sickbay, ok?\u201d Lucy didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not in denial,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what was done to me. I feel it, even now. But the worst is long over. I understand why everyone has their doubts, but I wish people would listen to me when I say I\u2019m fine!\u201d Owen sighed. \u201cWell, good. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok. But I can\u2019t help worrying about you, Lucy.\u201d She almost asked \u201cWhy,\u201d but the look on his face drew her up short. His concerns were etched into the lines around his ice-blue eyes, and deeper emotions seemed to dwell just under the surface of his gaze. Suddenly, Lucy didn\u2019t know what to say. She stared into his eyes for a long moment, looking for a clearer sign of what he was thinking. Bobby cleared his throat again. Owen cast an annoyed glance at his colleague, then looked back at Lucy. \u201cYour eyes are changing again,\u201d he said. \u201cOh?\u201d said Lucy. \u201cNow what are they doing?\u201d Owen smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re going back to normal. They\u2019re dark brown again, and the makeup is fading, too.\u201d Lucy was relieved to hear it. She glanced down at her arms and saw her porcelain pallor was returning to its natural, olive tones. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. Another beat of silence passed, and suddenly it felt awkward. \u201cWell, the Doctor\u2019s going to start wondering where we are,\u201d said Owen. \u201cRight,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She turned around to head towards sickbay, but at the mention of the Doctor, she remembered the bloodbath that the holonovel had become, and her anger returned in force. \u201cBut I swear, if he tries to blame me for the outcome of that terrible program\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll vouch for you,\u201d said Owen. He put a comforting hand on her shoulder, and soothing warmth seemed to suffuse her body from the touch, working wonders for her temper. She was halfway tempted to put her hand over his until he began gently pushing, trying to urge her back into motion. \u201cYou did everything that could be expected from a junior science officer.\u201d The way he qualified his statement rubbed Lucy the wrong way. She pushed his hand away and turned on him again. \u201cWhat, you think you could have done better?\u201d she challenged. Owen just pointed down the corridor towards sickbay. \u201cHmpf,\u201d said Lucy, and she turned around and marched the rest of the way to sickbay without looking back.      \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ensign, I can\u2019t clear you for duty yet.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Lucy, \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t save some of the hostages?\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d said the Doctor. They were back in the Doctor\u2019s office, and Owen and Bobby were back to guarding the entrance to sickbay. For now, Lucy and the Doctor could converse in private. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cgo all Michael Bernam? Maybe that would have worked in that two-bit hack holonovel, but in the real world\u2014\u201d \u201cI said\u2026\u201d the Doctor tried to talk over her, but Lucy steamrolled forward. \u201cThose sorts of shoot-from-the-hip heroics just start wars and get people killed! I tried to get into their heads. I tried to find their motivations so I could work out a peaceful resolution! Little did I know, they were all just cartoon villains! If you took me to the holodeck just to play a shoot-em-up, why even\u2014\u201d \u201cEnsign Kang!\u201d the Doctor shouted, and finally, Lucy broke off her tirade. \u201cYour performance in that\u2026 \u2018two-bit hack holonovel\u2019 that I wrote\u2026\u201d  Lucy cringed.  \u201c\u2026is not the issue. The goal was never to judge you by the outcome of the scenario, but to assess your mental condition by your behavior under unfamiliar and stressful circumstances.\u201d Lucy absorbed this fact and struggled to process it. \u201cIs this because I bought a hat, then?\u201d The Doctor sighed. \u201cNo. It was not any single decision or mistake that you made.\u201d"}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 7 \u201cI say we fly Voyager in there and ram a few photon torpedoes up their aft ventral porthole! See how they like that!\u201d Lieutenant Torres raged.  The senior staff was gathered in the conference room, minus Chakotay, who was still being held captive on the space station. They hadn\u2019t been sitting at the conference table more than a couple minutes before Torres was back on her feet, though, pacing back and forth down the length of the table. Janeway regarded the hot-headed engineer patiently, deciding it would be better just to let Torres vent her frustrations and get it out of the way. After all, she was just giving voice to the frustration that pervaded the whole room. They were angry, and they were worried for Chakotay, and everyone needed to acknowledge it\u2014everyone but Tuvok, of course.  \u201cThe Delurididug Trade Hub holds significant strategic advantages over Voyager,\u201d he Vulcan-splained. \u201cIt exists within an isolated region of space, over which it appears to control both ingress and egress. It has far more advanced technology than Voyager, it generates far more power than Voyager, and its immense bulk likely hides defensive systems significantly more formidable than Voyager\u2019s. Such a confrontation is unlikely to end in our favor.\u201d Torres waved off his objection. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if the station is armed. We scanned every inch of it, and I didn\u2019t see an operational weapons system.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said Tuvok, \u201cWe have been able to discern very little about key functions on the station. We cannot identify a computer core, a power source, or any form of warp field generator. And yet, we have ample evidence that the station has each of these systems. Therefore, the station is either employing technology so foreign and advanced that we cannot recognize it, or it is somehow disguising these systems from our scans. The same could go for weapons.\u201d B\u2019elanna shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s unmanned. Whatever advanced technology may or may not be on board is useless if no one is there to operate it.\u201d Tuvok arched an eyebrow. \u201cIs it your contention that the A.I. of the station is incapable of autonomous self-defense?\u201d B\u2019elanna looked uncertain for a moment. Then she threw her hands up and plopped herself back into her chair. \u201cOh, how the hell should I know?\u201d she said. Tuvok nodded. \u201cWell put, Lieutenant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not know enough at this time to justify putting Voyager at risk.\u201d \u201cSo what, then?\u201d said Torres, \u201cDo we abandon Commander Chakotay? Or do we play along? Throw ourselves on the mercy of a long-defunct court and the judgment of a malfunctioning hologram?\u201d \u201cWhether or not we take that course should depend on the laws of the court in question. I am still in the process of familiarizing myself with the Delurididug legal code. It is a curious system of governance; a technocratic meritocracy, its laws rigid, yet robust; idiosyncratic, yet imminently logical. Once we have an adequate understanding of their laws, we may be able to formulate an effective defense for Commander Chakotay.\u201d \u201cAnd what if we can\u2019t?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t have a case? Then what do we do?\u201d \u201cMaybe we can plan a jailbreak,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI would calculate our odds of securing Commander Chakotay\u2019s escape as less than one point five percent, given their ability to neutralize our weapons inside of the station,\u201d said Tuvok. \u201cAnd even if we manage to pull it off, we can forget about getting a wormhole to the Federation,\u201d said Harry, \u201cOr curing Ensign Kang.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid there are other hurdles where Ensign Kang is concerned,\u201d said the Doctor. The others turned to the wall monitor that displayed the Doctor\u2019s image. \u201cWhat\u2019s the status of your patient, Doctor?\u201d said Captain Janeway. The Doctor took a moment to consider his response. \u201cWell, physically, her condition is downright superhuman. I\u2019ve been monitoring her vitals and activities remotely since she left sickbay. She spent an hour in the deck eight gymnasium, during which time she performed a complete calisthenics routine at three times standard gravity, ran twenty-five kilometers, and burned over four thousand calories. Her pulse never exceeded one hundred twenty beats a minute, and as far as I can tell from remote sensors, there was none of the lactic acid buildup in her tissues that such a strenuous workout should have produced. Afterward, she ordered an eighteen hundred calorie meal from her personal replicator, and at last check, she appeared to be sleeping. I\u2019ll be able to tell you more about her physical condition in the morning, after her next physical. \u201cPsychologically\u2026 The results of my assessment were deeply ambiguous. Her problem-solving abilities are excellent, but prior testing suggests this is a pre-existing trait. Her regard for life and her empathic instincts are very strong, but by the same token, her capacity for emotional detachment is lacking. Again, this matches the results of her prior psychological assessments. In these regards, her personality is essentially intact. \u201cOne item of concern is her lack of cautious reflexes. If she saw a snake by her foot, for instance, she would not jump away from it on instinct. She would register the snake, decide consciously if it were a threat, and reason out an appropriate reaction. By the time she decided what to do, the snake might have already bitten her ankle. Her power of reasoning is excellent, but in emotionally fraught and emergent situations, I\u2019m afraid this cognitive deficit will present a powerful liability. \u201cOf even greater concern are the cognitive enhancements that she has begun demonstrating. During the assessment, I chose to deprive the ensign of her universal translator. Seeing as many of the characters in the program spoke only 20th Century French, I thought this would provide an additional challenge. Instead, the ensign learned a new language, fluently, in a matter of minutes\u2014just by being in the presence of people speaking it. The implants are certainly interacting with her brain, providing cognitive enhancements in specialized tasks like language acquisition. As to any other ways they may be affecting her cognition, I can\u2019t yet say. \u201cBut what concerns me most of all is that the ensign is starting to show a strong reticence towards the notion of reversing her condition.\u201d There was a beat of quiet around the conference table as the staff absorbed the Doctor\u2019s meaning. Evidently, none of the others had considered that Ensign Kang might not want to be cured. \u201cWell, I guess I can\u2019t really blame her,\u201d said Tom. The others all looked at Tom, and he sat forward in his chair. \u201cHey, she\u2019s got superpowers,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\u201d Tuvok\u2019s eyebrow crawled about halfway up his scalp. \u201cFiguratively, I mean,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd she\u2019s unrestrained by negative emotions. That sounds like it would be hard to give up.\u201d \u201cActually,\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cShe has quite a few negative emotions. Unfortunately, without the ability to express sorrow about her circumstances, her emotional release seems to come primarily in the form of anger. She\u2019s resentful, Captain. She feels she should have been consulted before Commander Chakotay led a risky away mission on her behalf. She resents being treated with suspicion and kept from resuming her post. So far, her reason and her sense of empathy seem to be working to defuse her anger, but I\u2019m not convinced it will last.\u201d Janeway nodded to the Doctor. \u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, I think she has a point,\u201d she said. Then she addressed the room.  \u201cTorres, Kim, get to work analyzing all the data we have on the structure of the station. We need to learn as much as we can about its external hardpoints and its internal structure. Paris, get with Lieutenant Ayala and start on that jailbreak scenario.  \u201cTuvok, I\u2019ll need you sorting out their laws and devising our case. Gather all the help you need, from any department.  \u201cIf we can beat their legal system, we will. If we can\u2019t, we go with a jailbreak. And in case that fails, Torres, Kim\u2026 once we know everything we possibly can about that station, start working on a way to cripple it. Once we have the upper hand, maybe the station will listen to reason. But that\u2019s our last resort. \u201cDoes anyone have questions?\u201d \u201cWhat about Ensign Kang, sir?\u201d said the Doctor. Janeway rested her chin on her hand a moment, her gaze far away, as she considered the problem. \u201cThat is the question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Finally, she braced her hands against the table and pushed herself up to her feet. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I paid her a visit. Now, let\u2019s get to work, people. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d      Lucy writhed languidly against the silky fabric of her bedsheets, reveling in the afterglow. Owen rested his head on his hands and stared up at the deckhead, an easy, almost sedated smile on his face. She rolled over to face him, propping herself up on her elbow. He cast a sidelong glance her way, and she quirked a questioning eyebrow. He reached out and ran his hand through her hair just above her left ear, gently massaging her scalp with his fingertips. \u201cAre you petting me like a dog right now?\u201d said Lucy, although she made no move to stop him. His touch sent happy shivers through her whole body. \u201cJust making sure you\u2019re not secretly a Deltan,\u201d said Owen. Lucy gave a breathy chuckle. \u201cWhy, because you\u2019re afraid my lovemaking has left you incurably insane? Or is it because my hair looks like a wig?\u201d Deltans had a near-human aspect, minus cranial hair. They were also legendary love-makers, with passions so intense they could literally drive a human mad. Or that was the legend, at any rate. Lucy doubted it could be entirely accurate. \u201cDefinitely the first one,\u201d he said."}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 8 Chakotay sampled a dab of protein paste and grimaced. It resembled old, plain oatmeal, congealed and devoid of flavor. Chakotay took a moment to gird himself, then he picked up the tube of paste and squeezed its contents directly into his mouth. \u201cUgh, ack.\u201d He grabbed the water bladder he\u2019d been provided with his meal and bit down on the valve to let the liquid free, washing down the slimy paste with three deep gulps of lukewarm water. \u201cI know, putrid stuff,\u201d said Hux. \u201cNot that I have any direct experience, mind you, but I\u2019ve fed similar concoctions to twelve thousand, eight hundred and twenty-two other detained visitors over the millennia, and all but one hundred and fourteen of them provided unfavorable reviews.\u201d Chakotay took one more pull on the water bladder and swished it around his mouth, clearing the last bits of paste from his palate before swallowing. \u201cOne and a half stars,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse, but not by much.\u201d Hux nodded thoughtfully, no doubt adding another negative review to his tally. \u201cWell, it\u2019ll keep you nourished, at any rate. The Delurididug Trade Federation does not neglect its detainees.\u201d Chakotay was forced to agree. The room in which the station held him captive resembled a budget suite at a Rigelian hostel more than a holding cell. The cot in the corner was clean and reasonably comfortable, there were a table and three chairs, there was a food slot on the wall where the protein paste had materialized, and there was an interface screen on the wall, although it was off, and it had no obvious controls. A single floating orb of yellow-white light hovered near the ceiling, providing comfortable illumination for the room. Chakotay contemplated the depleted tube of protein paste on the table in front of him, wishing there was something else he could eat. The modest serving of paste would probably sustain him in his captivity until his shipmates returned, but it was far from filling. Hux took a seat opposite Chakotay at the table and leaned in, resting his illusory weight on his holographic elbows. \u201cWould you like to try something you might find a bit more palatable?\u201d said the projection. Chakotay arched an eyebrow. No doubt, it would come at a cost. It occurred to Chakotay that he still didn\u2019t know what the Trade Hub actually traded for. \u201cUnfortunately, I haven\u2019t got any currency,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cThat\u2019s not such a problem,\u201d said Hux. \u201cThe Trade Hub receives many visitors who have no formal trade relations or currency exchanges with the Delurididug Trade Federation. We are more than happy to barter.\u201d Chakotay sighed and sat back in his chair. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have anything to barter, either. However, Voyager has stores of dilithium crystal, gold-pressed latinum, verterium cortenide\u2026\u201d Hux shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but from what I can gather of your people\u2019s technological development, I doubt you possess any kind of mineral wealth that we can\u2019t synthesize for ourselves on the station.\u201d That brought Chakotay up short. \u201cWell\u2026 Why don\u2019t you try me? What would you be interested in?\u201d Hux looked dubious. \u201cCrystalline benamite? Bioavailable kironide? Anti-protomatter? Polyphasic neutronium? Hexaburnium?\u201d Chakotay shook his head, suddenly feeling a lot less confident that they would be able to win over the station\u2019s cooperation through trade. He\u2019d never even heard of a few of the things Hux listed. Still, he pushed forward. \u201cWe might be able to track down some of those things on the other side of the wormhole if you make it worth our while,\u201d he said. Hux shook his head. \u201cBy the time you returned, your access point would be long gone.\u201d The hairs on Chakotay\u2019s neck rose, and he sat up in his chair. He reined himself in, though, not wanting his captor to catch him fretting. Affecting an air of nonchalance, he adjusted the sleeve of his uniform and said, \u201cThe wormhole isn\u2019t a permanent structure? How much longer will it last?\u201d Hux put his hands up in a placating gesture, as if Chakotay had exploded in panic. \u201cIt should last long enough for us to conclude our business, so long as your shipmates don\u2019t dawdle. Maintaining the access point over the long term simply isn\u2019t cost effective during the current Travel Network maintenance cycle, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Chakotay considered the hologram\u2019s words for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m curious, how long has the current maintenance cycle been in progress?\u201d \u201cFour thousand, one hundred and forty-one Earth years,\u201d said Hux. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right,\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cWhat kind of maintenance cycle is measured in millennia?\u201d Hux shrugged. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience. Occasional, unforeseen delays are inevitable in eight-dimensional, sub-spatial architecture projects of this magnitude.\u201d \u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s a way for Voyager to help you hasten your repairs.\u201d Hux shook his head sadly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s out of the question.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon have this current misunderstanding out of the way. I hope that when that\u2019s taken care of, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m heartened to hear you say that,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. But the workings of the Delurididug Travel Network are highly proprietary. We can\u2019t contract third-party labor. I can\u2019t even discuss issues of procurement with non-Delurididug parties.\u201d Chakotay did his best to push down his rising frustration and disappointment. \u201cWell, if you aren\u2019t interested in our material wealth, and you don\u2019t want help with your wormholes, what are you interested in?\u201d \u201cWhy, intellectual property, of course!\u201d \u201cOf what sort?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cAll sorts! Charts, schematics, scientific treatises, genomic and proteomic sequences, artistic and cultural works, you name it!\u201d Chakotay smiled. Voyager had detailed star charts from all four quadrants of the galaxy, a vast cultural database cataloging works from thousands of distinct civilizations, and similarly vast scientific and medical databases to match. If those were things the Delurididug valued, then the crew of Voyager was about to be VIPs. \u201cIn that case, Mr. Hux, I think we\u2019ll be able to do business after all.\u201d      \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to hold our own, sir,\u201d said Lieutenant Ayala. \u201cAt least briefly. Hopefully, long enough to free Chakotay and make an emergency beam out.\u201d Janeway found his confidence refreshing, if a bit over-optimistic.  The crew had worked straight through Gamma shift on devising a strategy to deal with the space station. The captain had ordered everyone to take a four-hour rest so they could attack the problem with fresh eyes, but then the telemetry from the wormhole started showing alarming signs. The subspace distortion that defined its aperture had abruptly weakened, and when it returned, it was far less stable. The wormhole was guttering like a candle at the end of its wick. According to their best estimates, the wormhole would flicker out in four to six hours. The captain called this emergency briefing to learn what all her crew had come up with to this point, hoping it would be enough.  \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019ll be able to beam out?\u201d said Torres. \u201cWe tried to beam Chakotay off the station before we left last time. It shrouded his comm signal and his biosigns behind some kind of dampening field.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll do it the same way we beamed Lopez off of Omekla III,\u201d replied Ayala. Torres smiled at the memory she shared with her fellow Maquis, then translated for the benefit of the Starfleeters gathered around the conference table. \u201cTransport enhancers,\u201d she said. \u201cAssembled in the field from a comm device, a tricorder, and some kind of a signal amplifier. I could modify the away team\u2019s equipment to serve the purpose. Nothing would look out of the ordinary when they\u2019re scanned by the station.\u201d \u201cWhat would you use for an amplifier?\u201d asked Janeway. \u201cThe feedback converter of a compression phaser rifle should do the trick,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way to know whether such a device would penetrate the Delurididug\u2019s dampening field,\u201d said Tuvok."}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 9 \u201cGood news, Commander!\u201d said Hux. The holographic avatar of the station apparated half a meter away from Chakotay\u2019s face, startling him out of his fretful reverie. \u201cYour crew have returned for you!\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re here now?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cThey\u2019ve just arrived through the Travel Network, and hardly a moment to spare. I have to confess, Chakotay, I was starting to worry for you. The operating window for that access point ends in twenty-five minutes!\u201d \u201cCan you extend that?\u201d said Chakotay. \u201cBy the time they come on board and the hearing gets underway\u2026\u201d He shook his head. Hux considered his point for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll need to enact emergency protocols to ensure that our business is concluded in a timely fashion.\u201d \u201cOr, you could extend the window another hour!\u201d Hux turned his back on Chakotay while he was still talking and faced the screen on the wall of Chakotay\u2019s cell, which flickered to life with a curious glyph for just a moment before opening a comm channel to Voyager\u2019s shuttlecraft. Chakotay could see Captain Janeway, Lieutenant Paris, Ensigns Kim, Vorik, and Kang, plus Chief Vance and Crewman Thorold crowded into the small craft. Chakotay\u2019s heart dropped at the sight of Ensign Kang. What could have possessed Kathryn to bring her back here? Hux clapped his hands with delight. \u201cOh, excellent! Everyone\u2019s here. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m Hux. I\u2019ll be your host here at the Delurididug Trade Hub.\u201d Janeway glanced past the hologram, and her eyes locked on Chakotay. She looked back to Hux and said, \u201cHello, Mr. Hux. I\u2019m Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager. May I speak to Commander Chakotay?\u201d \u201cCaptain, I\u2019m sorry, but time is short. I need your permission to transport your party directly onto the station.\u201d \u201cSend us the coordinates, and we\u2019ll start beaming over when we\u2019re ready.\u201d Hux shook his head. \u201cSorry, but we have to follow some very specific guidelines here, and as I said, time is short. I need your permission to bypass standard docking protocols and transport your party immediately. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to confiscate our stolen property and send you back out of Trade Hub space, straight away.\u201d Janeway\u2019s expression went icy, and there was steel in her tone. \u201cYou won\u2019t lay a finger on any member of my crew until we\u2019ve had our hearing, Mr. Hux. I\u2019ve familiarized myself with your legal guidelines, and\u2013\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really very sorry, Captain, but as I have told you more than once already, time is short! I must have your answer now: Will you permit me to beam your party aboard?\u201d Janeway hesitated for just a moment before nodding. \u201cExcellent. Everyone, please rise to your feet and collect any items you might need for the hearing. Is anyone staying behind on the shuttle?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Janeway, and she looked to Paris, who nodded and began entering commands on his console. \u201cThe shuttle will mind itself for the time being.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you all aboard in fifteen seconds.\u201d With that, the screen cut off. Hux turned back to Chakotay, beaming with excitement. \u201cI think we\u2019ve just narrowly avoided a disastrous outcome, Commander.\u201d Chakotay wasn\u2019t so sure.      When the channel cut out, Lucy and the other members of the away team leaped to their feet and set about readying their equipment. Lucy had less to carry than the others; everyone else had shoulder bags with data nodules, tricorders, padds, samples of ship\u2019s stores, and phaser rifles in place of standard-issue hand phasers.  All Lucy had was her trusty tricorder and a standard-issue phaser. She double-checked the settings on her phaser, then unsheathed her tricorder and set about reviewing its calibration and configuration. Abruptly, the deck beneath her feet seemed to light up with an eerie, pure white glow. Lucy looked up and discovered she wasn\u2019t on the shuttlecraft anymore. She found herself standing on a glowing, circular dais in a wide, domed chamber. Considering the light-up flooring, the featureless, alabaster walls, and the station\u2019s holographic salesman staring her directly in the eye, Lucy assumed she\u2019d been beamed onto the station. \u201cHello, Ensign Kang,\u201d said Hux. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t get a chance to meet on your last visit. How are those augmentations treating you?\u201d \u201cHello, Hux,\u201d said Lucy. She glanced around and noted the other members of the away team also standing on raised circular platforms of their own, and Chakotay was there with the rest of them, although his platform was surrounded with a shimmering forcefield. The platforms were strung like pearls on a choker around a shallow depression five meters wide. Hux stood at the center of the chamber, his feet a good half meter lower than the away team\u2019s, and yet he towered over them, standing at least four meters tall. Lucy regarded the projection cooly, saying nothing more. After a moment, Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway. \u201cThank you for agreeing to come aboard under such unorthodox circumstances,\u201d said Hux. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me much choice,\u201d said Captain Janeway. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Hux, tilting his head in consideration. \u201cNone of the alternatives you might have considered would have been wise, after all. Still, I\u2019m grateful that we were able to find our way to a civilized forum in which to settle our conflict.\u201d Janeway crossed her arms over her chest and looked the projection up and down, unimpressed with his immense stature and his casual arrogance. \u201cRight.\u201d Hux looked slightly disappointed at the captain\u2019s frosty demeanor, but he just sighed and pushed ahead in a rote tone. \u201cWe\u2019re here to adjudicate docket number eight-one-zero-six-six-nine-two, the limited commercial jurisdiction of the Delurididug Trade Hub, subsidiary of the Delurididug Trade Federation, versus Commander Chakotay of the USS Voyager, citizen of the planet Trebus and the United Federation of Planets, provisional officer of Starfleet, regarding alleged acts of industrial espionage, larceny, and use of Trade Hub services to circumvent native legal statutes. The defendant has the right to request an unaffiliated party from the Delurididug Trade Federation to serve as arbiter in this case.\u201d  Hux turned to address Chakotay directly. \u201cThe defendant has elected to waive this right in favor of an expedited hearing, is that correct?\u201d Chakotay nodded. If they demanded a living Delurididug arbiter, they\u2019d be waiting an eternity for one to arrive. \u201cAnd how does the defense plea to the aforementioned charges?\u201d \u201cNot guilty,\u201d said Captain Janeway. Hux turned his attention to Captain Janeway. Janeway went on, \u201cLet the record reflect that Captain Kathryn Janeway, Commander of the USS Voyager, citizen of Earth and the United Federation of Planets, officer of Starfleet, has chosen to represent her subordinate officer regarding all charges presented by the Trade Hub, per statute nineteen, sub-statute six of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.\u201d Hux nodded. \u201cVery well. The defense may now summarize their arguments in support of their plea on behalf of the defendant. Please be brief.\u201d Janeway took a deep breath and began to speak. \u201cThe original away team, led by Chakotay, arrived at what appeared to be an abandoned space station after passing through a wormhole deep in the unexplored reaches of the Nekrit Expanse. The away team undertook a mission of peaceful exploration, not espionage or piracy, in accordance with my orders.  \u201cThe away team entered the Trade Hub after receiving an automated invitation to dock. The away team received no further guidance or communication from the station after docking, and so they commenced to explore the space station on their own recognizance. They were seeking some means of expediting our trip back to our own civilization, which is situated on the far side of the galaxy. At no point were they provided with the station\u2019s Terms of Service. This is in spite of statute one, sub-statute two, paragraph two of the Terms of Service, which states that the Trade Hub shall provide a complete copy of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service to all guests upon their arrival in Hub Space in a format and a language that the guests can readily interpret. \u201cIn spite of this lack of guidance, at no point did the away team lie or steal from the station. However, the station appeared to malfunction, inflicting its augmentation technology on my officer against her will. This officer, Ensign Lucille Kang, is the wronged party, not the Trade Hub. Ensign Kang is owed recompense for harm and suffering inflicted by the Trade Hub under statute five, sub-statute one-oh-three of the Delurididug Trade Hub Terms of Service.\u201d Hux absorbed Janeway\u2019s statement with a neutral expression, and when he was certain she was finished, he went on, \u201cAt this time, the tribunal will receive all available evidence which is pertinent to this case. The tribunal presents as evidence the operational and security logs of the Trade Hub that were recorded at the time of the alleged misconduct, the subsequent statements of the defendant and the other witnesses, and the Aug-Tech subject Ensign Lucille Kang, which is able to act as a reliable record of the events by virtue of her illegally obtained Aug-Tech implants. \u201cIf the defense has evidence to submit, now is the time.\u201d"}
{"text": "  CHAPTER 10 \u201cCaptain, please! Do something!\u201d Owen shouted. Janeway looked back from the co-pilot seat and studied her bereft pretty officer. With all six seats in the shuttle occupied, Owen was left standing in the aisle, hands braced on the backs of Crewman Thorold\u2019s and Ensign Vorik\u2019s chairs. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can, Chief,\u201d she said. Other than Thorold and Vance, every member of the away team was tapping furiously on their consoles, running all manner of scans, conducting diagnostics on the shuttle, and reestablishing contact with Voyager. \u201cLieutenant Tuvok\u2019s hailing us, sir,\u201d said Harry. Janeway tapped a couple keys, and Tuvok\u2019s face appeared on the shuttle monitor. \u201cCaptain,\u201d said Tuvok. \u201cDo you require assistance?\u201d \u201cGet the ship\u2019s sensors trained on the energy signature of the wormhole,\u201d said Janeway. \u201cFind a way to reopen it. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be coming back aboard.\u201d \u201cCaptain, there\u2019s no time!\u201d said Owen. Janeway froze for a moment, composing herself. Then, she addressed Owen calmly. \u201cStand down, Vance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing things clearly. Thorold, give him your seat.\u201d Thorold got to his feet in a flash. \u201cI\u2019ll stand, sir,\u201d said Vance, \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same.\u201d \u201cI said stand down, Chief!\u201d Janeway shouted. \u201cNow sit in that chair and get ahold of yourself! That\u2019s an order.\u201d Owen honestly didn\u2019t know if he was capable of sitting down at the moment. She was back there on that station, trapped with a malevolent hologram that could literally turn off her breath with a thought! Every moment he spent on this shuttle doing nothing, the chances of getting back to her in time seemed more remote. He looked from the empty chair to the captain, who was still watching him expectantly, and he forced himself down into the seat. The moment he sat down, Owen went to work on his console, checking the shuttle\u2019s weapon systems. To his surprise, the phasers weren\u2019t even online. What if they found a way back through the wormhole? He couldn\u2019t let the station catch them with their pants down. He started warming up the phasers, just in case, and then his console went dark. At first, he thought it was a malfunction. He looked around at the others, still going about their business like normal, and realized the truth\u2013he was being cut off. The captain didn\u2019t trust him with a live console all of a sudden. Owen clenched his fist and brought it down on his console screen as hard as he could. \u201cChief Vance, you\u2019re relieved of duty,\u201d said Captain Janeway, sounding calm once more. \u201cYou\u2019re to report to sickbay as soon as we\u2019ve docked.\u201d \u201cCaptain, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Owen spoke through clenched teeth. \u201cI can help! I need to\u2026\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through, Chief,\u201d Chakotay interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to trust us, though. We\u2019ll do everything in our power to get her back.\u201d Owen met Chakotay\u2019s commiserating gaze, and a powerful urge to scream, shout, rail and rage started welling up in his breast.  She\u2019d been right there. He\u2019d held her in his arms. They\u2019d outsmarted the station! They\u2019d won! How could she have just vanished again, after all that? He took a deep breath in and made himself let it out slowly. The impulse to rage and bellow wasn\u2019t subsiding. All he could see was her face, smiling up at him from the transporter pad. All he could feel was the ghost of her hands touching his cheek and his neck. The shuttle needed to dock soon, or he was going to lose it completely in front of the captain and the whole senior staff. It was all his fault. He\u2019d let Lucy down, every step of the way. She was mutilated by that pod in the first place because of his inability to protect her. She\u2019d felt alienated from the crew because he\u2019d failed to stand up for her when she needed it most, and that was why she\u2019d been all gung-ho to return to the station. She\u2019d thought she had to prove herself. He should have talked her out of it. He should have done whatever it took to keep her from going back there. He should have acted faster when the hologram started toying with her in that tribunal chamber. He shouldn\u2019t have hesitated, he should\u2019ve just started firing right then\u2013no, that was wrong. He shouldn\u2019t have fired at all. That was the excuse the station had needed. It threatened to hold the captain or Chakotay over the damages, but it was obvious she was the one it wanted all along, and dammit, she just couldn\u2019t help but play the martyr. Why couldn\u2019t she just\u2026 Why couldn\u2019t he stop her from\u2026  Owen wasn\u2019t going to be able to contain himself any longer. Out the forward viewport, Voyager\u2019s shuttlebay doors loomed large, but he wasn\u2019t going to make it. \u201cPermission to hit the head, sir?\u201d he asked Chakotay, who sized him up with a glance before nodding his permission, and Owen vaulted out of his chair and lurched over to the refresher, locking himself in. The moment he was alone, his rage and grief erupted out of him, and the others in the small shuttlecraft were polite enough to pretend they couldn\u2019t hear it.      \u201cGet in,\u201d said Hux. Lucy and he stood in the room with the frosted pillars that Lucy had seen on her first visit to the station\u2013the ones that held biomatter in stasis. She assumed, now, that they held other prisoners of the station.  A moment ago, she\u2019d been haranguing the imperturbable hologram in the tribunal chamber, unwilling to let him get a word in edgewise. She\u2019d been almost willing to take the burden of being the station\u2019s hostage before, but coming so close to cheating that fate had reminded her how unjust this situation really was. Whatever his legalistic excuses may have been, Hux didn\u2019t have the right to imprison her in this stars-forsaken pit at the bottom of subspace. Then there was a flash of light, and now they stood in front of one of the pillars. Its glass-like, cylindrical wall was rendered transparent, and an opening the width of a doorway faced Lucy. Lucy looked from the pillar to her jailor, and she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cNo.\u201d Hux raised an eyebrow. \u201cMs. Kang\u2026 Lucy\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Ensign Kang, Mr. Hux,\u201d said Lucy. Hux shook his head. \u201cNot anymore, I\u2019m afraid. You\u2019ve been lawfully confiscated by the Delurididug Trade Hub. You\u2019re no longer a member of Starfleet or a citizen of the United Federation of Planets, and you\u2019re no longer bound by their laws or regulations.\u201d Lucy rolled her eyes. \u201cSays who, you? You\u2019re just a derelict hunk of space junk left over from a dead civilization, long faded from the annals of history. Neither I, nor Starfleet, recognize your legal authority.\u201d Hux shrugged. \u201cI know that\u2019s your opinion, but it\u2019s at odds with your legal reality. The Delurididug Trade Federation exists here, regardless of whether it does or doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, and you\u2019re now a part of it, same as me. So, I\u2019ll tell you again: get\u2026 in\u2026 the\u2026 chamber. Lucy shook her head. \u201cMake me.\u201d Hux sighed. > root/query access:> executive initiation :: override Lucy was scandalized. She had an override? \u201cI knew it, you liar!\u201d she said as she stepped into the tube. \u201cI don\u2019t lie,\u201d said Hux. It was only after she was standing inside of the pillar that she had the wherewithal to even consider resisting his order, and the willpower to step back out again was slow in coming. It didn\u2019t stop her from speaking her mind, though.  \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t modify my executive functions. You\u2019re such a liar! This whole ordeal was just a trap, wasn\u2019t it? You staged everything, just so you could capture a Starfleet officer.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d said Hux, \u201con all counts.\u201d The clear walls flowed into the open doorway like water, leaving no trace of the opening in the featureless glass."}
{"text": "  Mirror Vulcan, Mirror Not By Erin Blackwell Spock stood with his back completely straight, hands folded behind him, and wondered why he had allowed this to happen. He knew it would; there had been no margin of doubt. And yet, when it came time, he made sure the woman was assigned here with him. He had, however, warned her. He told her what she would be facing and suggested she might prefer to remain elsewhere in the Empire\u2019s fleet. She had replied, quite logically, that she was already receiving the same treatment and she preferred an assignment with him. And, as he well knew, he needed her. He needed a new Chief for his personal guard, someone utterly loyal and totally committed to him. It had to be someone he could trust and she was the only one he trusted now. If he was to move any further in the challenge given him by the parallel Kirk, he had to have just such a person with him. So he had agreed and arranged the assignment. Saavik stood in front of Kirk for her first inspection. His eyes were travelling insolently down her body in the tight revealing uniform. Spock clenched his hands together more firmly. This was what he had expected. It was known throughout the ship that a crewwoman\u2019s first inspection ended in Kirk\u2019s bed: captain\u2019s orders. Spock\u2019s presence would not deter it. Kirk abruptly frowned as his eyes reached waist level. Pointing to the clip hanging from her belt, he asked, \u201cWhat are those for?\u201d She glanced down briefly at the collection of Imperial insignia pins, unique in their design of a dagger embedded in a planet. \u201cThey\u2019re from the people I\u2019ve killed. My way of keeping count. Sir.\u201d She allowed a half-smile when Kirk sat straighter in his desk chair. Nothing of her Vulcan nature was evident and the POW tattoo on her left forearm only emphasized her Romulan half. If Kirk knew more about the war camps\u2019 numbering system, he\u2019d know this particular tattoo marked her as a Vulcan/Romulan hybrid. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to be Spock\u2019s new Chief,\u201d Kirk continued. \u201cYes, sir. Of his personal guard.\u201d \u201cSince his previous one was killed.\u201d He locked eyes with her. Spock must know that it was his guard who had murdered Stek. Therefore, Saavik must have been told. \u201cA regrettable action, sir.\u201d Kirk relaxed back into his chair. Better. She was less arrogant now, more easily approachable. He directed his next statement at Spock. \u201cYou can go now. She\u2019ll be at her post later.\u201d The Vulcan did not move right away, ready to argue that Saavik was, after all, his personal guard. He was not supposed to be without her. But Kirk\u2019s next words left no doubt that he was quite serious, and the agony booth was not too far away. \u201cThat was an order, Mr. Spock.\u201d There was no further choice. The Vulcan gave a nod of his head and turned on his heel to leave. He hesitated as he passed Saavik but she made no sign that she considered anything wrong. She gave him the same mocking glance she gave Kirk which, Spock could see, the captain noted."}

There is nothing left to do but wait \u2013 wait and watch the nightmarish feeding frenzy of the Monster. Dim, cold radiance from the Indrii singularity trickles into the cabin through the open forward viewport. The glow from the maelstrom of dying atoms bathes the shuttlecraft\u2019s interior with a vague light that dances and ripples across the glassy surfaces of the dead control panels. McCoy mumbles something incoherent. He\u2019s as comfortable as Scott can make him, his unconscious form arrayed on the floor between the rows of seats, his head cushioned by a rolled-up Starfleet field jacket. The head wound has stopped bleeding, thankfully, but the doctor has yet to regain consciousness. The bloodstains on his blue uniform tunic appear black in the dim, ethereal light. At least the doctor is spared the indignity of floating around the darkened cabin, Scott muses grimly. Although unpowered, inertia will keep the stator in the gravity generator spinning for many hours \u2013 providing synthetic gravity to the shuttlecraft Copernicus long after the demise of her two occupants. Scott envies the doctor\u2019s oblivion to the race in which they are both unwilling participants, a competition by various specters of death to be the first to claim their lives. The front runner is suffocation as the oxygen content of the shuttlecraft\u2019s atmosphere is depleted. A close second is the black hole itself, threatening to consume them as their orbit rapidly decays. Other participants include hypothermia and the invisible but deadly X- and gamma rays that pour unimpeded through the unshielded shuttle hull.

Where are you going to spend it?\u201d He shook his head at the Chief Engineer\u2019s noncommittal shrug. \u201cOh, let me guess. You\u2019ll stay here on the ship to make sure the Starfleet techs don\u2019t scratch your precious, wee bairns during the baryon sweep.\u201d He popped the bean into his mouth and smiled"}

While on a routine patrol mission to Outpost 7, Enterprise has received a distress signal from a Federation colony located on planet M64 in Sector 13. Enterprise is the nearest ship in this sector and as such we have responded to the call. The delay should, at most, be no more than a few hours.\u201d Captain James Kirk completed the recording, hitting the button on the arm of his command chair and settling back. \u201cMister Spock,\u201d he said, turning toward the science station, \u201cWhat information do we have regarding M64 and the colony there?\u201d Spock swiveled his chair to face the captain. \u201cAll Federation scans to this point have revealed the planet to be uninhabited with the exception of lower animal life forms and for the most part, it is highly vegetated and has a stable, temperate climate. A Federation colony was begun there approximately one year ago to study the indigenous plant and animal life. Most recent contact with the colony was six months ago, at which time there were no reported problems.\u201d \u201cSo whatever happened there probably happened very suddenly and recently,\u201d Kirk surmised. \u201cThat is a possibility, Captain,\u201d Spock replied, \u201cHowever, I would hesitate to make such presumptions without additional information. Six months is a long enough period of time for any number of things to have happened.\u201d \u201cKlingons?\u201d \u201cPossible, but not probable. This is far afield of their usual sphere of influence. Even Romulan intervention, though more probable, would likely not explain the situation.\u201d Kirk nodded slightly and turned toward the communications station. \u201cLieutenant Uhura, play back the distress call.\u201d \u201cAye, sir,\u201d she responded. Her slender fingers played lightly over the keys and within seconds a nearly hysterical voice sounded over the bridge com. \u201cThis is Commander Martin of the M64 colony. If anyone can hear this, please \u2013 please help us! We can\u2019t get away \u2013 most of our people are dead already! They mean to kill us all!  You must help us!\u201d The message lapsed into static. \u201cIt\u2019s a recording, Captain,\u201d Uhura volunteered. There is no way of determining how long ago it was made. I have continued to monitor and there have been no new messages.\u201d Kirk nodded in acknowledgement. Who was \u201cthey,\u201d he thought. \u201cCaptain,\u201d Spock announced, \u201cWe are approaching the planet.\u201d \u201cThank you, Mister Spock. Engage forward view screen.\u201d A blue-green planet with a hazy cloud cover shimmered in the distance and slowly filled the screen. \u201cStandard orbit, Mister Sulu.\u201d \u201cAye, sir. Plotted and laid in.\u201d Lieutenant Commander Sulu set the coordinates with practiced precision. \u201cSpock,\u201d Kirk said, rising from the command chair, \u201c I want you to head up a landing party to the surface. We\u2019re going to find out what happened down there.\u201d Spock stood to face him, hands folded loosely behind his back. Kirk continued. \u201cTake a three-man security team, a medical officer of McCoy\u2019s choice, and that new transfer from Yorktown\u2026\u201d he hesitated, \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Spock stiffened imperceptibly. \u201cLieutenant Gaines.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d Kirk turned to Uhura. \u201cRelay the coordinates of the distress signal to the transporter room and have Lieutenant Gaines and the security team meet us there.\u201d \u201cAye, sir.\u201d \u201cAnd tell McCoy I need one of his officers for a landing party in 5 minutes in the transporter room.\u201d Uhura nodded and began making the calls as Kirk moved toward the turbolift, his first officer following. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Transporter room one bustled with activity as the landing party assembled and checked their gear. The door hissed open to admit Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock, and the crew came to quiet attention. \u201cDr. Wilson,\u201d Kirk addressed the young, dark-haired man who stood before him. \u201cDr. McCoy tells me that you can handle just about anything that comes up.\u201d The youthful doctor nodded. \u201cYes sir. I specialized in combat medicine.\u201d \u201cGood. We don\u2019t know what to expect down there.\u201d The captain stopped, taking in the landing crew. \u201cAs for the rest of you, be on the alert for anything. The colonists were not specific with their message; all we know is that a life-threatening situation exists where six months ago there was none. Mister Spock is in command and can fill you in on any necessary details.\u201d He paused again, scanning their faces. Good crew, he thought. He turned to his first officer. \u201cMister Spock, keep us posted. McCoy is standing by in sickbay to receive survivors, but use discretion; if there is any trouble I want you out of there \u2013 understood?\u201d \u201cUnderstood, Captain.\u201d Spock motioned to his small crew to take their positions on the transporter pads. Lieutenant Phyllida Gaines, standing on the pad nearest Spock, flashed him a smile, which he chose to ignore. \u201cNice to see you again, Mister Spock,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEnergize,\u201d came the Vulcan\u2019s command. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The landing party materialized inside a small room that seemed more than anything like the aftermath of a tornado. Assorted crates and machinery lay scattered about amid rubble from a ceiling that seemingly threatened to fall at any moment. Though signs of struggle were evident, there were no inhabitants and no bodies to be seen. In the corner, Spock\u2019s tricorder registered the presence of a small terminal buried beneath the rubble; its insistent flashing indicated a message was still being sent. He switched it off. Spock glanced around the room, taking in the eerie silence, and addressed the crew. \u201cWe will separate into groups of two and scout the colony area, taking complete tricorder readings. Ensign Davis,\u201d he indicated one of the security men, \u201cYou team up with Doctor Wilson. DuPuy and Echols, you make another team. Lieutenant Gaines, you are with me. Keep your communicator frequencies open and report anything the least bit unusual; we will meet back here in half an hour.\u201d A chorus of acknowledgements followed as the crew spread out and began their search. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Kirk had not been back on the bridge for more than 20 minutes when Chekov reported from the science station that a large ion storm was approaching. \u201cETA, Mister Chekov?\u201d \u201cI vould estimate 2 hours at its present course and speed, Keptin.\u201d That doesn\u2019t give Spock much time, Kirk thought. \u201cVery well, Lieutenant. Maintain surveillance of the storm and let me know of any change.\u201d \u201cAye, Sir.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 On the surface, Spock and his party had turned up nothing remarkable except one small detail. Despite a search of the immediate area surrounding the beam-down point, there were no bodies; no trace of the colony could be found apart from the abandoned and ruined instruments. Checking his tricorder readings yet again, Spock moved toward the doctor. \u201cDr. Wilson, you can locate no disease-producing organisms? Anything that can account for our findings?\u201d The young doctor looked at him with puzzled eyes. \u201cNo, Commander. It\u2019s strange, too, that they should just disappear like this. I really am at a loss to explain it. If I could just find some physical remains I might be able to determine a cause.\u201d \u201cYes \u2013 fascinating. Carry on, Doctor.\u201d \u201cYes, Mister Spock.\u201d In answer to the beep that had just sounded, Spock flipped open his communicator. \u201cSpock here.\u201d"}
{"text": "    STAR TREK A Second Home   by Cory Pelc   For my wife\u2014and her acceptance of my quirks.    CHAPTER 1 Leonard McCoy was tired. Tired of dealing with the constant threats to the well-being of the crew, and tired of filling out the endless death certificates. The last such \u201cadventure\u201d had claimed a total of twelve crewmen. Twelve young lives lost in the name of exploration, McCoy thought.   Of those lost, two crewmen were taken quickly by an allergic reaction to the native flora of the planet. A ship that can take men across the galaxy protected by shields and photon torpedoes, and we still can\u2019t save someone from acute anaphylactic shock, McCoy thought to himself. Shortly after beaming down to the surface of Rynair II the men accidently inhaled a bit of pollen that proved fatal. The only saving grace of the situation was that the pollen only affected an individual who was also allergic to Elonian zongs, which McCoy noted in his log were roughly the equivalent to an Earth coconut. Thinking of this, McCoy shuddered slightly realizing how easily the ship could have been without three members of the senior crew, as Jim, Spock and himself had beamed down along with the landing party. Probably not Spock, McCoy thought, those damned Vulcan bodily functions probably have a back-up measure even for anaphylaxis. McCoy knew and accepted death as something which every doctor deals with from time to time, but he was unnerved that these sort-of situations seemed to be the norm at this point in his life. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way, he told himself. As much as he enjoyed his friendship with Jim and his whatever-you-might-call-it with Spock, McCoy never had felt at home in space. One thing that had always reminded McCoy of home was a good drink. As a proud \u201cSon of the South\u201d, it was almost bred into him. At the moment, he felt like a drink might be the best friend he had. Grabbing a bottle from his shelf and taking a seat behind his desk in sickbay, McCoy poured himself some Saurian brandy. He sipped the strong liquor, attempting to relax and allowing his mind to drift back to a time in his life before Starfleet. Back then, his drink of choice was a Mint Julep, but he felt like the replicators onboard the Enterprisecould never get them quite right. Maybe it\u2019s because the temperature is always 72 degrees in here, with simulated sunlight, McCoy thought in a matter-of-fact sense. A Mint Julep is meant to be enjoyed on a hot summer evening. Evening\u2014even that has no meaning in space. McCoy sighed and poured another glass. \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Growing up inGeorgia, young Leonard Horatio McCoy always pictured himself as going to medical school, settling down with a beautiful belle, and living the life of an \u201cold country doctor.\u201d But, for whatever reason, he only got two of those three goals checked off his list. His wife Jocelyn was everything he had hoped for since the first time they met back at that high school dance. But after their daughter Joanna was born, it seemed to him that Jocelyn changed overnight. He never had evidence of her cheating on him, but every time he looked at Joanna the thought would arise.  Is she really my daughter? He would ponder as he looked down into his daughter\u2019s crib. Does it matter? \u201cLeonard! Leonard! Where are you?\u201d \u201cOut here on the back porch Jocelyn!\u201d McCoy replied, while sipping a Mint Julip and watching the sun set on another August day. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d Jocelyn said as she finally found her husband. \u201cI think we both know that this isn\u2019t working anymore. I was fine staying at home being the \u2018Doctor\u2019s Wife\u2019 but now I feel like I\u2019m the \u2018Parent of the Doctor\u2019s Daughter\u2019.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean Jocelyn?\u201d McCoy said, while feeling more than a little blindsided. \u201cWhat I mean is that you go and sit in your clinic everyday and help people, and I\u2019m stuck here raising our daughter by myself. Sometimes I think that you care more about your patients than your own wife and daughter!\u201d she exclaimed with the force of months of suppressed thoughts. \u201cDammit Jocelyn! I\u2019m a doctor, not a daycare provider! I spent years going through medical school to help these people and this is the thanks I get?\u201d He angrily replied. \u201cWell I went through eight and a half months of pregnancy, concluding with delivery of our child and this is the life I get? A husband that is out of the door before sunrise, and with drink in his hand at every sunset? I could have gone to school too, in California, but I chose you.\u201d \u201cWell I guess you have another choice to make.\u201d He said, turning his attention back to the sunset. \u201cI\u2019ve already made it. You should be hearing from my lawyer in the next few days. Until then, Joanna and I will be staying with my sister.\u201d Jocelyn sternly replied at her husband who was still refusing to look at her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and stay at Clay\u2019s house. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be glad to have you.\u201d McCoy said as he closed his eyes. He knew he had gone too far and regretted it instantly. \u201cUnbelievable!\u201d She screamed. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before that things between him and I ended a long time ago. Due in large part to you, I might add. Leonard, I was always faithful to you, even though you\u2019ll never be half the father that Clay might have been for Joanna.\u201d With that, Jocelyn McCoy walked back into the house; the house that Leonard realized would soon be hers along with most all of Leonard\u2019s money and possessions. He wondered if he\u2019d be lucky enough that she didn\u2019t take the bones from his body. McCoy sighed and made himself another drink.  CHAPTER 2 \u2026Sweet home Alabama! Lord I\u2019m coming home to you!\u2026.That was one from way-way back in the 20th Century folks, but still a great way to start your morning! We\u2019ve got 10 in a row headed your way next!\u2026 \u201cHmmmmrph!\u201d Leonard slowly sat up in bed and told himself that he was getting too old for this routine. Without even opening his eyes he could sense a hungry grandchild standing next to his bed wearing the devilish grin of someone who had just turned on her grandfather\u2019s radio to get his attention. \u201cYes darlin\u2019?\u201d Leonard asked her. His drawl was always more pronounced before having his morning coffee. \u201cGrandpa, can we go to the zoo today?\u201d The little girl asked as she pulled on his comforter. \u201cPerhaps dear, but first we\u2019ll need to ask Grandma. We both know that she\u2019s the one that calls the shots.\u201d  McCoy stretched, slipped on his house shoes and pulled on a robe. He reached to his nightstand and grabbed his PADD to open up the day\u2019s newspaper\u2013Outbreak on Vulcan Outpost: Federation Seeks Help of Medical Community\u2013the main headline read. Makes sense, thought McCoy, pointy-eared logic lovers can\u2019t even display enough emotion to ask for help themselves. McCoy punched in the code for coffee on his replicator as he continued reading. Damn fake coffee. Joanna had bought him and Jocelyn the replicator for their anniversary last year and he had finally started using it\u2014but not before he passionately explained to Jocelyn that part of the charm of coffee is its simplicity. If it was good enough for the settlers of this land so many generations ago, then it didn\u2019t need to be upgraded. McCoy continued reading\u2013\u2026in light of the Organian medical and peace conference being held in conjunction with the Klingons, all essential Starfleet Medical personnel are unable to assist with this emergency. The Federation hopes that some of the more experienced physicians and nurses from Earth and Andoria will volunteer to assist in this urgent matter. Because the outbreak seems to only affect Vulcan individuals, it has been determined to be too great a risk to seek assistance from the Vulcan Medical Academy. For those interested in volunteering locally, shuttles will be leaving from the Atlanta Shipyards at 1200 hours today. \u201cGrandma said we can go! Grandma said we can go!\u201d Lucy yelled as she ran back into the kitchen. \u201cCan we leave soon?\u201d \u201cSure little lady, but first Grandpa has to get ready. And so do you\u2026unless you plan on showing off your pajamas to the elephants.\u201d Leonard walked back towards his bedroom and found his wife getting ready for the day. He set his PADD down on her dresser and stood behind her as she looked in the mirror. \u201cGood morning Mrs. McCoy\u2026\u201d He said, trying to goad a response. \u201cGood morning to you, too, Dr. McCoy.\u201d She responded. \u201cThat\u2019s only Monday through Friday. It\u2019s the weekend and I\u2019m as much a Mr. as I choose to be.\u201d \u201cWell today it sounds like you\u2019re a Grandpa, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll treat Lucy with just as much care as you would a patient.\u201d \u201cStill bringing that up\u2026\u201d McCoy said with a grin. It had been twenty five years since his marriage had almost fallen apart. He was close to joining Starfleet back then, just to get away from the mess of his divorce. Medicine On The Cutting Edge \u2013 Practicing in Space the advertisement had read. He had been to space once before as an observer shortly after graduating from Ole Miss. He knew then that he wanted to be a doctor, but he was pretty sure he wanted to keep his practice local. As in on Earth, he had joked to himself. Instead of enlisting, he decided to cut back his office hours and make the effort to work things out with Jocelyn. It turned out that she had run back to Clay during their separation and divorce, but shortly after Jocelyn saw that Clay had not changed as much as he claimed. McCoy knew that it wouldn\u2019t be easy\u2013the divorce was finalized and they had to get married again\u2013but he made a choice to use it as a fresh start and he was glad that he had. Most importantly, he was glad that Jocelyn had given him the opportunity. \u201cSo is this goodbye?\u201d Jocelyn asked. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I thought we\u2019d both go with Lucy today.\u201d A confused McCoy replied."}
{"text": "  Forward Here Posted is the first TWO Chapters of a 25 Chapter Book. I wrote this 20 years ago, for fun, while trapped in the subway to and from work every day. Thought it might be intriguing to put it out there. I am just editing as I go along so the other chapters will come fast\u2026.. CHAPTER 1 It had always been his practice to wake up at least an hour before his duty shift began. Besides the fact that it assured he was alert by the time he reported, he had always believed that a man should spend time in quiet meditation before he started his day. Of course now he had the power to spend as much time contemplating as he desired. After all, his duty shift may be twenty four hours a day, but being a commander in the Romulan Navy also afforded him the luxury of managing his time as he saw fit. Still, Commander S\u2019Tal prided himself in his dedication to duty; not in a conceited, arrogant way, but with a fulfilling satisfaction that he was an honourable man. He had seen many a ship\u2019s commander abuse his position and shirk his duty. Honour and duty was the fibre that made a good man; that was the heritage from which the Romulan Empire had grown and what would always remain in those who served the Romulan Way. Today, like most other days, he awoke to the beckoning of the computer\u2019s masculine voice efficiently repeating a clipped military style wake up call. It did not take many conscious moments for his mind to turn to the upcoming mission. \u201cComputer,\u201d he spoke to an invisible speaker that he had always felt was in the ceiling even though he knew it was built into one of the walls. \u201cOpen the Starscape.\u201d Open was not really the correct term since the wall did not actually open up into space. Instead, the computer adjusted the tint of the huge transplanium window that made up the wall curving into the ceiling of S\u2019Tal\u2019s quarters. It was not his style to use his position to get comforts that were not readily available to the rest of his crew. Nevertheless, he had indulged himself the luxury of the viewport he now looked through. Looking through the enormous window he could not help but be struck by what he saw. For all the trillions upon trillions of light years that made up the universe, when he looked out into space he was amazed at how two dimensional it all seemed. Every speck of light he saw could be an inch in radius and a few meters from his ship, or they could be a thousand times the radius of Romulus\u2019 sun and a million light years away. No man had the eyes or mind to truly perceive the notion of depth in the vastness of space. S\u2019Tal found the stars even more beautiful when he was actually viewing them with his own eyes, instead of the computer generated images he saw on the bridge. It was easy to get caught up in the aesthetic beauty of the stars, especially when they took on a surreal quality caused by the rippling effect the cloaking device created. Still, he had no time to spare daydreaming about the beauty of the stars when he needed to prepare for battle. The Praetor himself had endorsed this mission for which S\u2019Tal, his ship, and the Vatrium were preparing. The Praetor had been convinced by his advisors that the time was right to move against the Federation. They argued that for too long now the Romulan Empire had been denying their true destiny as masters of the galaxy because they feared themselves not strong enough to conquer the Federation.  Now those advisers had convinced the Praetor that the empire was strong enough to win   if they could gain an early advantage.  The purpose of this mission was to give them that advantage. The years of peace had been good to the Empire; her people had grown as a society and had conquered or settled hundreds of new planets.  Honour lay with the military and duty was served by all.  S\u2019Tal had gained his position through outstanding military service in wars with the Gorn and the IKS on the Triangle border.  He had seen war and understood the necessity to wage it.  However, this action against the Federation was different; it did not feel right for him, or for the Empire.  He did not fear for himself \u2013 in fact, he looked forward to dying in his Commander\u2019s seat, as a real warrior should.  He feared for what the war would do to the Romulan society.  Regardless of what the Praetor\u2019s advisors said, the war with the Federation would be long and costly. S\u2019Tal had never actually battled a Starfleet vessel, but was well studied in their design and abilities.  It was this expertise that led to his assignment on this particular mission.  For all of the Empire\u2019s technical advancements, his ship, one of the most powerful in the Royal Navy, was barely a match for many of the Federation\u2019s cruisers. Romulan commanders were superior when their positions had been earned \u2013 of that he was sure -, but too many command positions had been given to undeserving men who knew someone of importance.  So where was the advantage in a war with the Federation?  S\u2019Tal knew he would be successful in completing his mission, but whether it would give the Empire the element of surprise and superior knowledge remained a question. S\u2019Tal got out of bed, went over to the food synthesizer, and returned to the small table that was set up against his wall viewport.  He was far too preoccupied with the mission that would begin today to worry about a proper breakfast.  This morning a cup of hot corum would suffice.  He sipped his root broth as he wondered how honourable it was to fight the Federation, who had shown no aggression to the Empire.  When he was a young man, S\u2019Tal had thought that fighting was always a source of honour.  As he aged, the fighting seemed endless and killing his so called enemy often seemed like hurting innocent people.  More and more, S\u2019Tal was coming to the realization that true honour lay in protecting peace and the strength of the Empire.  If it took war to do that, then so be it.  He did not feel this was the case with the Federation, which was, for the most part, an honourable entity. That last thought brought an audible chuckle from his throat.  As a Centurion aboard the Cl\u2019Torin he had been furious at the espionage of a Federation captain and his first officer who conspired to steal a cloaking device.  S\u2019Tal had been severely reprimanded for his inability to destroy the Federation vessel when it was fleeing with a stolen Romulan cloaking device.  S\u2019Tal had been slow to react to the Enterprise cloaking and it escaped. It was his anger at being duped that drove him to be so great a warrior.  He also vowed to become the foremost expert on Federation military organization.  He found that his anger ran out of steam after a couple of years. His Commander later showed him that Federation officers were capable of great honour when that same command crew of the Enterprise worked together with her against Omne. She had been right to trust them even though her career was lost.  He actually developed an admiration for Starfleet and its most powerful ships and decorated officers. Still, of course his heart lay with his Romulan Empire.  He had fought for the prosperity of its people.  He had sworn his life to the Praetor and regardless of the consequences or possible futility of war with the Federation, he was going to honour his oath.  Duty was the utmost priority to Romulans   and S\u2019Tal was, above all else, a Romulan.  With renewed determination, he rose from his seat and began to dress in his Romulan commander\u2019s uniform. \u201cClose viewport.\u201d  The viewport darkened on cue as S\u2019Tal added the honour sash to his uniform.  He reached up to the Romulan Bird cluster that held his sash in place and touched it with his forefinger.  It beeped to life.  \u201cS\u2019Tal to bridge,\u201d he clipped in an efficient military tone.  \u201cI\u2019m heading to PTB room three.  Inform Commander Tark that I will be transporting over as scheduled.\u201d \u201cImmediately, Commander,\u201d S\u2019Tal heard as he left his quarters. Tark revelled in the command seat.  He often spent many off duty hours on the bridge.  He had spent years of his life in the security sections of various ships, dreaming of getting to where he was now   in the command seat. It was from the command seat that one could be part of the strategy of battle.  He was addicted to combat, he could admit that.  This was not a vice to a Romulan, provided he had self control and could make the right choices about when to battle, always ensuring the Empire came before personal needs. Many years of his life had been spent studying every great strategist in the known galaxy.  It did not matter to Tark whether the object of his study was an enemy or an ally, his admiration transcended political and ideological boundaries.  In fact, some of his favourite strategists were from the Klingon and Federation starfleets.  Captain Garth was his chosen commander when it came to fighting against numerous opponents.  General Kord from the Klingon Empire was outstanding at directing and participating in multi vessel encounters.  Yet his favourite was Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the Federation cruiser Enterprise.  It was Kirk who was able to turn any situation to his advantage.  Kirk, who never accepted defeat even if he had to sacrifice his own ship to win. Tark had spent several years as captain on smaller ships, most of them old and lacking any real power.  It was his knowledge of Kirk and his expertise on combat strategy that got him command of the Vatrium.  His ship was the first of its kind, the first special missions cruiser in the Imperial Fleet.  It had the power to beat the best from the Federation.  Still, he could only hope that it would come to battle with Federation ships, hope to meet Kirk in combat someday.  Nevertheless, it was his duty to ensure the success of this mission regardless of the cost; even if he had to give up the chance to battle Kirk. Success ensured power.  He would command as long as he was successful.  Command was what he wanted most in life.  As he looked around the bridge at his crew, it occurred to him that they were his to command.  As long as they were on his ship, their lives were his to control, they were extensions of himself on the bridge.  The communications officer was his ears and voice to communicate with others.  His helm and Nav officers were his legs to take him where he wanted to go.  Fists to pound the enemy were provided by his weapons officer, and his engineer was a doctor to care for the body.  The bridge was the brain of the ship and he was the brain of the bridge. He could not resist smiling to himself.  Here he was a Romulan commander, and he was comparing his ship to his body and himself to a brain; such were not the musings of a Romulan.  He moved his attention from his inward thoughts to the main viewscreen.  The now split screen showed the forward starfield on one half and a navigational projection on the other.  The navigational projection showed his ship\u2019s location alongside the frigate K\u2019Lester, the two starship\u2019s course projection, and the border markings that represented the Triangle and Federation neutral zone boundaries. Tark turned to his science officer\u2019s station, \u201cAny ships on long range sensors yet?\u201d \u201cNothing yet, sir,\u201d the man answered quickly.  \u201cWe should be within scanner range of any enemy vessel patrolling the Federation side of the Neutral Zone and the Triangle boarder in\u20261 hour, 22 minutes.\u201d \u201cExcellent, inform me as soon as you detect anything.\u201d \u201cYes sir.\u201d The officer firmly punched the left side of his chest and then extended his arm so that his hand was just above the level of his shoulder. \u201cCommander,\u201d came the call of his communications officer from his post beside the science station. \u201cWhat is it Centurion?\u201d \u201cThe K\u2019Lester informs us that Commander S\u2019Tal will be transporting over on schedule.\u201d \u201cConfirm,\u201d Tark answered, and then added as he headed for the speedlift, \u201cI will be in PTB room one to meet him.\u201d Tark enjoyed S\u2019Tal\u2019s company, they shared many of the same interests.  There were so few men in the Empire with whom he could talk to about some of the Federation\u2019s greatest strategists.  Since being assigned to this mission, he and S\u2019Tal had spent many hours in simulated starship battle with the simusence helmets and he looked forward to one more before the mission operations began.  Tark had a special recreated simulation that had just been programmed based on a recent event in the Federation. He wanted to run the new simulation with S\u2019Tal.   CHAPTER 2 Captain\u2019s Log, Stardate 2/2305.28: The Enterprise\u2019s\u201a first four weeks of patrol duty on the Triangle boarder have concluded without any serious incidents. As is often the case on long and uneventful patrol duty, the crew is losing concentration and becoming bored. I am sending a recommendation to Starfleet, that following the six weeks of our patrol duty, the crew of the Enterprise be given shoreleave on the planet of Lakeland. The two Federation patrol vessels immediately adjacent to us have also reported no note worthy incidents. The Sputnik\u201a in the sector to the galactic north of the Enterprise\u201a   has monitored no activity in its sector and has completed resupply of Outpost 1 along the Romulan Neutral Zone. The Appollo\u201a to the galactic south has reported a tediously sparse amount of activity in its sector bordering the Triangle. Captain James T. Kirk wearily pushed the button on the arm of his command chair that switched off the log recording device.  The thought of continuing patrol duty for another six weeks was devitalizing to say the least. Yet he felt at ease now; now that he was no longer behind a desk. There was a time when he had thought setting fleet procedure behind a desk would be preferable to patrol duty. After experiencing the life of a staff officer, he was resolute that his calling in life was to command a starship   to command the Enterprise. He looked around at his bridge and the efficient crew, who by merely pushing buttons and flicking switches, made the 170,000 megaton Enterprise fly through space at speeds many times faster than the speed of light. He could think of no words to express his feelings at that time. He felt a mix of awe at the thought of travelling at such an incredible speed, and genuine feelings of loyalty for and from his crew \u2013 his friends, no, his family. He knew that it was, in many ways, egotistical to think of the Enterprise and her crew as his, but he often found himself doing just that when he sat in the command chair. There could be no doubt that this chair was his. Looking back now, he found it hard to believe that he had ever given up his ship and taken the appointment as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Even more incredible that he had given her up a second time after the V\u2019GER incident. Those years spent in a desk chair he had constantly dreamed and hoped of again sitting in the command chair of the Enterprise. Now he was and he would not easily give her up again. The previous five years had seen three serious threats on Terra and the Federation of Planets. He had lived through all of them. His ship, his crew were heroes, but there were heavy casualties. The Enterprise and her crew had paid for their heroes\u2019 welcome with their dearest blood. James Kirk had lost the son he had only briefly known but had loved as much as any father could. It had taken Kirk several long introspective hours and several long talks with Dr. McCoy to realize that it was his friends on the Enterprise that were his family. Still, there could be little reconciliation for the losses he felt. Nevertheless, all was how it should be once again. The first watch surrounded him, everything felt right. Uhura was at her communication console, her fingers moving across its dimensions as they had for so many years. She seemed to have aged the most gracefully, he decided. She was perhaps even more handsome a woman now than in her younger years. To her left was the familiar back of Mr. Spock. Kirk was very pleased when Spock had told him that he would stay on the Enterprise as First Officer and Science Department Head. Spock had been satisfied with his role as a Starfleet instructor, but had felt the strongest emotion that Vulcans will admit to having \u2013 curiosity. He had a desire to discover things that had never before been discovered, to understand things as yet not understood, to go where no one has gone before. It was this last phrase, to \u201cgo where no man has gone before \u201c, that had made Spock decide to request starship duty aboard the Enterprise.  Spock had told Kirk when he filed his request to stay on board the Enterprise, that he had been reminded of his own personal charter by reading the Enterprise\u2019s. Spock had always known the charter of the Enterprise, but it was during that time when the Captain, McCoy and himself were locked in the forward observation deck by Spock\u2019s brother that he had the opportunity to really contemplate the importance of the Enterprise and her crew to what he was; to what he had become. He had come to the realization that it was the duty aboard the starship with his friends that truly fulfilled his one true destiny \u2013 and made him content. It was a statement to which Kirk had no argument, so even though it meant Spock giving up his command, Jim Kirk had processed and endorsed the request. Directly in front of him, Kirk rested his eyes on the team that had guided the Enterprise through more kilometres of space than any other ship in Starfleet history. Chekov had turned down a promotion to command a vessel of his own to stay aboard the Enterprise as Department Head for Security and Weapons System, as well as third in the chain of command. Kirk remembered his misgivings about Chekov turning down the promotion. Chekov was adamant however, he would continue to learn from the best until it was time for him to move up to command the Enterprise. Sulu was a mainstay in Jim Kirk\u2019s crew, Kirk knew that Sulu would stay on the Enterprise for as long as they would allow him.  Sulu had piloted the ship in every battle manoeuvre in Starfleet\u2019s combat textbooks as well as some that would be added to them. He flew the Enterprise like it was an extension of himself. Sulu also could have had a command position on a ship of his own but had made it clear to Kirk that he was going to wait for a chance to command the Excelsior. He had told Kirk that there was no reason to leave the best ship in the fleet unless he had the chance to command a ship he could make the best. To the Captain\u2019s far left, sitting with his back to the command chair watching his instruments as though the ship were in a battle was the one man who loved the Enterprise as much as Jim Kirk did \u2013 of that he was sure. Montgomery Scott would also stay with the Enterprise until he was forced to retire. Scotty had revelled at the prospect of spending his days in this new Enterprise. Kirk remembered what Scotty had said when he learned of the new Enterprise\u2019s equipment, \u201cAch, me baby\u2019s finally got the best equipment thot Starfleet has ta offer. And \u2019tis about time too, a shame it took her destruction for those inept fools ta realize it.\u201d It was Scotty who had complained the loudest about the new Enterprise not being as good as the old . It had not deterred him however; he continued to work her into shape and when the time had come, she performed beautifully and saved the lives of all aboard her. It was not long after the trip to the centre of the galaxy that Scotty was again claiming that the new Enterprise was befitting the name and was his baby. \u201cAfter all,\u201d Scotty had told Kirk, \u201cit was those inept fools at Starfleet w\u2019at ha\u2019 put her tagether wrong.\u201d The memory brought a broad grin to Jim Kirk\u2019s face. \u201cNow what\u2019s that grin for? You look like the cat that swallowed the bird, \u201ccame the voice of the Enterprise\u2019s Chief Medical Officer and Kirk\u2019s long-time friend and companion. McCoy had grumbled about signing for the five year mission. He had claimed that he would be old and grey by the time he got back, and that space exploration was no way for a man to be spending his twilight years. Someone had to take care of Kirk, though, and he had decided that he was the only man alive capable of having any effect on what Jim Kirk did. \u201cHello Bones, I was just thinking back to Scotty\u2019s comments about his baby finally getting the best from the inept fools at Starfleet,\u201d Kirk answered instigatively. The remark had its desired affect for Spock\u2019s head popped up from his watch over the science console. Kirk felt the weariness of patrol duty lift off his shoulders as he straightened for the exchanges that were sure to ensue. \u201cCaptain, I was unaware that Mr. Scott was involved in the conception of the Enterprise, and in fact, that conception of an inanimate object was possible,\u201d Spock offered without even a trace of sarcasm. He had learned long ago that while working with humans it was important to their morale \u2013 and therefore their efficiency \u2013 for them to have a nearly constant environment of humour. It was for this reason that he allowed himself to partake in their bantering back and forth as the \u201cstraight man \u201c. It was logical. \u201cSpock,\u201d answered Dr. McCoy, \u201csurely you must have realized that it was only a joke and that Scotty was not suggesting that he had a biological part in the Enterprise\u2019s creation.\u201d"}

Takes place after \u2018First Contact\u2019 The Enterprise was on its way to  Starbase 412. Rest and shore leave awaited them. Picard was happy that they had made it. After the recent mission against the Borg, he was ready for it. The dark circles under his eyes showed that he was tired. He leaned back in his chair, and watched as the stars slowly streaked by. They might still be eight hours away, but the smiles on the face of the crew, showed that they were happy to just be heading for the starbase. Picard smiled at that to. He looked around the bridge of the Enterprise-E. It was a fine ship, with a fine crew. Once again they had saved earth. Crew replacements would be made at the starbase. Picard looked at the helm station. Ensign T\u2019Ripo was at the helm, replacing Lieutenant Hawke, who had been killed while fighting the borg. Inside Picard mourned the loss of all of his crew. But he wouldn\u2019t let it show. He couldn\u2019t he had to be strong, to give the crew strength. Commander William T. Riker sat in his chair. He looked around the bridge. The normal compliment. He still whished he had the center seat though. One day, one day he would, and the Enterprise would be his ship. Lt.Commander Data, Chief Operations officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise- E sat at his station. Geordi had replaced his missing skin, and he was back to normal. It felt good to. He had turned the emotion chip back on, and was now just like a normal human. His station beeped letting him know something was on sensors. What he found, gave him a little bit of a shock. Deanna Troi walked onto the bridge. Her hair flowed down her head, as she took her seat. She smiled. The crew was in better spirits. She liked that. She pulled on the turtle neck of her uniform. She couldn\u2019t understand why Starfleet wanted to change the uniforms again. They had only been changed a few years ago, and now they had been changed again. Next thing anybody knew, the commbadges would change. \u201cCaptain, you might want to take a look at this,\u201d Data said, turning in his chair, to face the Captain. \u201cWhat is it Mr.Data?\u201d Picard asked, walking over to the androids station. \u201cThis nebula just appeared on sensors, I am picking up a warp trail leading through it,\u201d Data replied. \u201cWhat kind of warp signature?\u201d Picard asked. \u201cI would judge, that it is, Romulan sir,\u201d Data said. \u201cRomulans, in Federation space.\u201d Picard said."}
{"text": "  THANK Q by Walt Chmara Lieutenant Commander Data stepped through the swishing door of sickbay. As it resealed itself behind him, he noted Doctor Beverly Crusher, near the center of the room. Crusher\u2019s normally professional manner was interrupted when she saw who entered. Her facial expression betrayed a this-is-it look, which Data recognized from a quick scan of his human-watching file. It meant she had something to tell him which she felt was going to be difficult for one or both of them. \u201cYou sent for me, Doctor,\u201d he informed her, pleasantly. She tried to keep a steady gaze into his yellow-tinted eyes, but found that her own were disobediently wandering about. \u201cUh\u2026yes, Data. There is something here which requires your presence, and I\u2019m not sure which one of us is going to need to sit down more when I tell you what that is.\u201d She had rehearsed this moment in her mind for some time, but now was struck mute. It didn\u2019t help that she wasn\u2019t quite able to believe the facts, herself. In frustration, she slapped the sides of her blue labcoat, then pulled Data by his right arm back out the door he had just entered through. \u201cData, have you ever considered what the purpose is for creating an android which imitates a specific gender of human being?\u201d she asked of him, as she led him through the hall to a destination only she knew. \u201cYes, Doctor. It was, in fact, my fourteenth consideration since I had achieved consciousness. Unfortunately, I was never able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on the matter. Perhaps it is an arbitrary decision on the part of the creators, since humans only come in the male or female variety, and associating with one which appears to be neither may be aesthetically distressing to some.\u201d They entered the obstetrics office, where they were greeted by three pregnant women. Crusher didn\u2019t give Data much chance to return the greetings, towing him straight through to the incubation ward. Inside, they stopped before a particular fetal development tank, whose viewport was switched off. Data looked curiously around, as he never had any business to be here, before. \u201cHow would you react if I were to tell you that you, Data, are a father?\u201d Data searched his memory banks for an answer that would be as close to reality as possible. \u201cWith much skepticism, Doctor. That would imply that I was constructed with an ability to sire offspring, which is extremely unlikely.\u201d Crusher gave him a wry grin before touching the viewport panel. A small embryonic humanoid faded into view, floating quietly in the tank\u2019s fluid. \u201cSay hello to your offspring, Data! Or should I say `Da-da\u2019?\u201d \u201cConfirmed,\u201d boomed Lt. Worf at his station on the bridge, consulting sensor data, as well as the screen. \u201cA ship\u2019s recorder-marker. This one came from the starship *Anaxagoras*.\u201d Picard nodded, more in confirmation to himself. \u201cThe *Anaxagoras*. The name I had been expecting to hear.\u201d First Officer William Riker was seated to the left of the captain\u2019s chair."}
{"text": "  STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION THE BRIGADE OF THE DOOMED CHAPTER ONE Captain Jean-Luc Picard walked onto the bridge in an unusually happy mood. Starfleet Command had finally given the Enterprise permission to explore the Seraris Regions. That area of space was one of the most mysterious sections of the Alpha Quadrant, and the Enterprise was going to explore it first. If anyone in civilized space hadn\u2019t heard of the Enterprise before this mission, after it, they most certainly would. \u201cYou\u2019re sure in a happy mood,\u201d Counselor Deanna Troi noted as Picard took his spot at the command chair. Commander Riker went to sit at the first officer\u2019s seat. \u201cI most certainly am,\u201d Picard told Troi. \u201cStarfleet Command has given us permission to explore the Seraris Regions.\u201d Troi looked shocked. Ensign Wesley Crusher\u2019s mouth hung open. Commander Riker asked, \u201cHow did you manage to pull that off?\u201d \u201cAdmiral Jordan is tired of all the mystery surrounding the Seraris Regions, and she felt that the Enterprise was the only ship for the job. Also, if there\u2019s anything valuable in the Seraris Regions, we want to have the first grab at it.\u201d Riker nodded. \u201cUnderstandable. Admiral Jordan also talked about sending the Yeltsin to explore the Seraris Regions some years ago, but she felt that Starfleet should wait and send the newly commissioned Enterprise to explore them when she felt the ship is ready.\u201d \u201cShe feels the ship is ready right now, Number One,\u201d Picard said. \u201cMr. Crusher, lay in a course for Starbase 123 at maximum warp. Engage.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Ensign Crusher turned to input the coordinates into the conn station, and he pressed the engage button. The Enterprise sped towards the last outpost before the unknown. Lieutenant Commander Data pressed the buzzer to Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge\u2019s quarters. \u201cCome in,\u201d Geordi said. Data entered the range of the sensor above the door to Geordi\u2019s quarters. The door whooshed open. Geordi was listening to the popular band \u201cThe Warps\u201d, who mutated jazz in an odd form that humans seemed to like. Data entered the quarters. \u201cI hope I am not disturbing you.\u201d \u201cNot at all Data.\u201d Data stepped further into Geordi\u2019s quarters. The door whooshed shut. \u201cI wish to know about all the wonder surrounding the Seraris Regions.\u201d Geordi got out of his chair and turned the music off. \u201cHow do you mean, Data?\u201d \u201cThere has been a great deal of controversy and myth surrounding the Seraris Regions. Little has been backed up by fact. Why does this particular region of space seem more important than any other unexplored region?\u201d Geordi sat back down in the chair and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Data. Perhaps it\u2019s because it\u2019s so close to us. That\u2019s the most likely explanation I can think of.\u201d Data nodded. \u201cAh. So you believe that when we get closer to the Gamma and Delta Quadrants, those regions of space will be like today\u2019s Seraris Regions?\u201d \u201cI guess. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cYou have been most helpful, Geordi. Thank you.\u201d Data exited Geordi\u2019s quarters. Lieutenant Worf struggled with his opponent. The creature was growing fatigued and was breathing heavily. That\u2019s when the Klingon abruptly stepped backwards away from the creature. The strategy surprised this dumb animal. Worf took out his dahktog and stabbed his opponent in the ribs. The thing fell to the ground, blood flowing from the wound. Then, the creature disappeared, as did the harsh enviroment surrounding them."}

They would survive it; Enterprise wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIt is a good day to die,\u201d Worf said as the shock wave was within moments of destroying the Enterprise. Captain Williams on the Ariel watched in horror as the shock wave took out the Enterprise.  It was so clean\u2026 there wasn\u2019t even any time to think about it. \u201cThere are\u2026 no debris\u2026\u201d Black said with puzzlement.  Then, she nodded. \u201cThe shock wave had residual tryolic waves, no doubt from the power core of the Garthusian sphere.

The alien vessel was nothing like he had ever seen before.  It had a large forward section shaped like a saucer, a large section in the aft section with two long protusions that appeared to connect to some kind of propulsion system.  It was also loaded with numerous other things he\u2019d never even dreamed of.  Kalome turned to his first officer, Commander Jafar.  \u201cWe will send over troops to investigate that vessel immediately.  It will belong to the Empire!\u201d \u201cAs well as increase your standing,\u201d Jafar replied. Kalome eyed the first officer warningly.  \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cNothing, sir.\u201d \u201cGood.  Now send over the troops!\u201d Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise awakened. He looked around him.  Everything was dark.  He had a hard time breathing.  He must have been in Hell.  It figured. He heard a noise to his right.  Picard looked in that direction sharply.  He could make out a form struggling to get up.  \u201cUghh.\u201d  It sounded like Commander Riker. \u201cWill?\u201d Picard said. \u201cCaptain?\u201d Riker answered. Picard felt around the back of him.  He felt a chair, with the same creaks and crevices of\u2026 the command chair on the Enterprise.  He must not have been in Hell after all.  Somehow, the Enterprise had survived the shock wave.  \u201cNumber One, we must restore at least partial power.\u201d     \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is,\u201d Riker said, standing up, \u201cwhy Starfleet didn\u2019t immediately come in and scan for survivors.

The Enterprise has been fully repaired at Starbase 121, and we now have replacement crew members for those who were killed battling the Garthusians or the Galactic Empire.  Also, Ensign Wesley Crusher is back in full health and is resuming his duties at the conn. Meanwhile, since the Battle of Feronium, there has been no Garthusian activity within Federation space.  Attempts at communication with Vraris have failed.  The Romulan Star Empire has also been quiet since Feronium. There is a mystery about the Romulans\u2026 why did they betray us at the Battle of Feronium?  As of yet, we have no solid answers.  It has been suggested that the Romulans and the Garthusians are allies, but that is difficult to prove.  The Klingons are subscribing to this theory, believing that the \u201cdishonorable cowards\u201d decided to join the stronger side than risk a fight to the death.  Anyway, communication attempts with Romulus have also met with failure. The Enterprise has been given the task of determing the relationship between the Garthusians and the Romulans.  It will not be easy.  Right now, the Enterprise is on a course for the Romulan Neutral Zone so we can begin our investigation.  Starfleet is also strengthening defences along the Federation-Garthusian border.

The ship was following the Borg Cube trying to divert it from its course to Earth.

Explosions rocked the vessel, throwing the Captain to the floor. \u201cDamage report\u201d demanded the Captain, staggering to his feet, \u201cHull breach on deck 24, main power to 15%, secondary power and emergency back-ups are destroyed, weapons are offline, shields are at 27%, Sir\u201d shouted his tactical officer, \u201cNumber 1\u201d he shouted, mimicking an old mentor and role model. His first officer was dead under some debris. The ops officer shouted up, \u201cCaptain, what\u2019s left of the sensors are detecting tachyon emissions \u201c. The Captain ignored that and shouted, \u201cHelm, all forward, lay in a collision course, Lieutenant, drop an emergency beacon with information about what happened here\u201d he ordered to his bridge staff, \u201cBridge to Main Engineering, shunt all available power to the impulse engines on my mark\u201d he said. He took a deep breath to calm himself, \u201cMark\u201d he said, \u201cPower shunted, Captain\u201d said the Chief Engineer. \u201cHelm, Engage\u201d he said. The ship moved forward, disintegrating as it went, the computers warning system kicked in, \u201cWarning, collision detected, impact in 30 seconds\u201d. The Captain watched with resignation as the Borg ship completely filled the viewscreen. Just before impact he saw a bright light, then lost consciousness. Stardate 48905.72. USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D. Earth Captain Jean-Luc Picard sat face to face with Admiral Edward Robertson. Sat next to him was Commander William Riker. The Admiral was briefing the Enterprise command officers as to their mission, \u201cCaptain, you understand this mission is to be classified, news of the possible return of the Borg could destabilise the Quadrant. Given that previous Borg attacks have been targeted at humanity, it might give those hostile to Starfleet the excuse they have been looking for to launch assaults along the Federation Borders\u201d said the Admiral, \u201cUnderstood, Sir, shall we be on our way, time is critical if it is indeed the Borg\u201d said Picard. The wizened Admiral nodded, \u201cVery well, Captain, I pray that I\u2019m wrong\u201d said the Admiral. The Admiral stood, shaking hands with Picard and Riker before leaving the briefing room. Before Picard or Riker could say anything, Lieutenant Commander Data contacted them, \u201cData to Picard, Captain, internal sensors are reading massive tachyon and chronoton emissions on deck 4\u201d he said. Picard and Riker looked at each other, \u201cAre you sure, Mr Data\u201d said Picard, \u201cQuite certain, Captain, the emissions seem to be occurring in an area about the size of a humanoid male about 6 feet tall\u201d said Data. \u201cVery well, Mr Data, have a security detail meet me and Commander Riker on deck 4\u201d said Picard, leaving the briefing room with Commander Riker close behind. 5 minutes later, Picard, Riker and the security forces sent by Data and Worf were at the area where the tachyons were concentrated. The corridor seemed normal. Nothing seemed out of place, \u201cPicard to Data, we have arrived at the area you directed us to, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything here\u201d he said. There was slight interference when Data responded, \u201cCaptain, the emissions are concentrating into one area, you might see something in the next few minutes\u201d said Data, through the interference. They did. As the emissions condensed and concentrated, a bright light filled the corridor. When it cleared enough for the crew to look, a man lay on the deck. His uniform wasn\u2019t recognisable, but the insignia showed he was a Starfleet officer. \u201cMedical scan\u201d ordered Picard. He watched the medic scanning the new man, and looked at him with a comparative eye. Whereas his uniform was black all the way up to the shoulder with red on the shoulders and a blue collar showing with his four command pips, the strangers uniform was black up to the shoulder where the shoulder pads turned grey. The collar was red and Captain Picard noticed that he was looking at another Starfleet Captain. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, Captain\u201d said a Security Ensign, \u201cPicard to Transporter Room Three, two to beam directly to sickbay\u201d said the Captain. They both dissolved and left the Commander and the security team on the deck. \u201cPicard to Riker, return to the bridge and set a course for Ceridian III, Warp 6\u201d said the Captain as Doctor Beverley Crusher examined her patient. The Captain watched the bustle quietly as they worked to heal the man\u2019s extensive injuries. Thirty minutes later, the medical team stepped away from the patient, \u201cI\u2019ve stabilized him for the moment, but he is very weak. The next hour should determine his rate of recovery\u201d she said. The Captain pondered the situation, \u201cCan you wake him\u201d he asked. The Doctor looked at him again, \u201cYes, of course, but he will be very weak\u201d she replied. Captain Mark Smith was slowly becoming aware of his surroundings. It took him a few seconds to realize that he shouldn\u2019t be able to become aware of his surroundings at all. He tentatively opened his eyes and saw a face that he hadn\u2019t seen in the 20 years since his death. Captain Jean-Luc Picard stood over him. This was impossible as the Captain had been dead for 20 years. \u201cMy name is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise\u201d he said briskly, \u201cI know who you are, Sir\u201d said Smith weakly, \u201cI\u2019m Captain Mark Smith, USS Lexington\u201d he said. Before the Captain could reply, Smith fed him the vital piece of information, \u201cCaptain, I grew up on this ship, I think I have travelled back in time\u201d he said. Picard didn\u2019t seem surprised, \u201cYes, we observed tachyon emissions around the time and place you were discovered. But who are you to have grown up aboard the Enterprise\u201d said Picard. Smith sighed, \u201cMy dad was the Deputy Chief Engineer who was killed in an EPS explosion when I was eleven\u201d said Smith, \u201cYes, Lieutenant Smith was killed a week ago, Mr LaForge is trying to find out exactly what caused the explosion. Counsellor Troi is working with, erm, you\u201d said Picard. There was a moment of awkward silence between the Captains. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Stardate where you\u2019re from\u201d said Picard. Smith cleared his throat, \u201c77371.95\u201d he said. The Captain sighed, \u201cWhat\u2019s Starfleet doing 40 years from now\u201d said Picard, genuinely interested, \u201cWell, Sir, there is lots I can\u2019t say because of the Temporal Prime Directive. I couldn\u2019t tell you much about the next forty years. However, for the last two years in my time, the Federation has been plagued by the Borg. The USS Alaska monitored several temporal distortions around the badlands, and a number of them had Borg signatures. When the Borg started hitting Federation colonies, the temporal schisms became a low priority\u201d said Smith. Picard looked at him, looking ever so slightly haunted at the mention of the Borg, \u201cWhat were you doing when you ended up on the Enterprise\u201d asked Picard. Smith wracked his brain, \u201cI believe that we were following a Borg vessel when we were detected. My ship was heavily damaged so I ordered all power to be diverted to the impulse engines and lay in a collision course\u201d said Smith. Picard responded instantly, \u201cCaptain, we are on a mission to investigate the sudden appearance of Borg vessels in the Ceridian System. There have been no Borg incursions since the Battle of Wolf 359, but a deep space sensor relay suddenly picked up about 20 signatures. The Enterprise has been sent to investigate\u201d said Picard. Smith frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s the precise Stardate, Sir\u201d said Smith, \u201c48905.72\u201d replied Picard. Smith suddenly had all his fears confirmed, \u201cCaptain, my recollection of this Stardate is the Enterprise going to Starbase 384 for weapons system refits\u201d said Smith. Picard looked at him, \u201cYes, but Admiral Robertson redirected us to investigate the readings from the deep space sensor array\u201d said Picard, equally concerned. \u201cIt would appear that some event has changed the timelines, quite possibly starting with the Borg invasion in my time, leading to the destruction of my ship to my appearance aboard the Enterprise\u201d said Smith. On the bridge Commander Riker was looking at the sensors with Data. \u201cWhat could be causing these readings, Mr Data\u201d said Riker. Data made a face that almost looked pensive, \u201cThe parameters do not conform to that of any known sub-space or temporal distortions currently on record, Sir\u201d said Data. Riker considered his options, \u201cAny theories\u201d he said. Before data responded, Worf spoke up, \u201cCommander, there is a Borg signature emanating from the distortion. A Gravimetric distortion extending from the main disturbance\u201d he said. Before the commander could give an order, the ship was enveloped in the gravimetric disturbance. \u201cRed alert, Captain Picard to the bridge\u201d said Riker, \u201cAll engines, full reverse\u201d he ordered. The ship shuddered violently as the helm officer carried out Riker\u2019s orders, \u201cCommander, engines are at full reverse, it\u2019s not having any effect\u201d said the helm officer. Down in sickbay, Captain Picard was deliberating with Captain Smith, \u201cCaptain, come with me\u201d said Picard. The Captains left the sickbay and walked towards the bridge. \u201cPicard to the Bridge, Number One, what\u2019s the situation\u201d said Picard. \u201cWe are caught in a gravimetric distortion expanding from a larger anomaly. Mr Worf has detected a Borg signature and Mr Data has no theories. Engines are at full reverse but it\u2019s not having any effect\u201d said Riker. Picard sighed, \u201cUnderstood\u201d he said. Riker was watching the situation evolve in front of him. \u201cBridge to LaForge, I need more power to the impulse drive\u201d said Riker urgently as the ship shook more violently, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can, Sir, but if we keep this up the manifolds will rupture and we\u2019ll be dead in the water\u201d said Commander LaForge. The turbolift doors hissed open and Captain Picard stepped out with the other Captain, Riker was aware of the ripple of unease at the stranger on the bridge. \u201cReport, Commander\u201d said Picard, \u201cSir our best indication is that a Borg vessel is about to emerge from the distortion, there are chronoton emissions emanating from the distortion\u201d said Riker, he looked at the other Captain, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this distortion could also lead to your time, Sir\u201d said Riker. Picard looked to Smith, \u201cSuggestions\u201d he said. Smith thought for a second. \u201cMr Data, can you display sensor readings or the distortion on the main viewer\u201d said Smith. Data complied instantly and Smith studied the readings, \u201cThis looks like a Borg Transwarp conduit, but the readings are unusual. Commander Riker\u2019s assessment is correct, Sir, this distortion could indeed lead to my time\u201d said Smith. He walked over to Worf, \u201cCommander, launch a photon torpedo at these coordinates , prime it to explode on arrival. The antimatter discharge may break the ship free, helm reduce power before the manifolds rupture\u201d he said, walking back to Picard and Riker at the centre of the bridge. He looked at Picard, \u201cReady, Sir, that should free the Enterprise from the distortion field\u201d he said. Picard nodded, \u201cMr Worf, fire torpedoes\u201d said Picard. Worf nodded, \u201cFiring, Captain\u201d. The torpedo flew from the ship, exploding right on target, \u201cCaptain, gravimetric distortion is weakening\u201d reported Data, \u201cHelm full reverse\u201d said Picard. As the Enterprise  reversed away from the distortion, a Borg vessel protruded from it. The vessel was enormous in size and scope. \u201cCaptain, engines are overtaxed from the effort of escaping the distortion, we must power down or the impulse manifolds will rupture\u201d said the helm officer. Picard focused on the helm officer, \u201cWarp Engines\u201d he questioned. The helm officer checked, \u201cNo, Captain, the gravimetric disturbances are interfering with the warp bubble I can\u2019t get it to stabilize\u201d said the helm officer. Smith stepped in, \u201cEnsign, is there a way to reduce the warp profile of the Enterprise\u201d said Smith. The Ensign thought for a second, \u201cYes but we can\u2019t do it from here\u201d she said, \u201c there is a malfunction in the command relays, it will have to be done from Main Engineering\u201d she said. Picard stood, tapping his communicator, \u201cPicard to Engineering, Mr LaForge, find a way to lower the warp profile of the ship\u201d he said. The Borg ship continued to emerge from the distortion when LaForge contacted them again, \u201cLaForge to Bridge, warp profile should be concealed\u201d said LaForge. The Borg vessel was fully out of the distortion and the distortion was dissipating. \u201cScan the vessel, Mr Data\u201d said Picard. Data scanned the Borg ship. \u201cIt is larger than the Borg vessels we have encountered so far, but its structure is perfectly geometric. There is a large section of damage to the vessel, indicating that a starship similar in size to the Enterprise collided with the ship\u201d said Data. A sound of anguish and pain came from Captain Smith. The crew looked at him, \u201cRemember what I said, Captain. The last thing I remember before waking up on deck 4 was my ship being heavily damaged in a Borg attack as a Borg vessel headed for Earth. I rammed the Borg to try and destroy them. I failed\u201d said Captain Smith, sinking to his knees. A beeping cut through the tension on the bridge, \u201cCaptain, we are being hailed\u201d said Worf. Captain Smith still knelt on the bridge, head held in shame, Captain Picard stood and walked forwards. Before he could order the channel open Worf said, \u201cWe are being scanned, Sir\u201d. Picard looked at the damaged vessel, \u201cOpen a channel\u201d he said. The screen showed an image of a terrible creature. It looked like a woman, only it had tubes sticking out of the crown of its head. Captain Picard and Captain Smith recognised it as a Borg queen. Her face showed an expression that had she not been an emotionless cybernetic abomination would have been likened to imperious and smug. \u201cLocutus\u201d she said to Picard. Picard\u2019s face stonewalled, \u201cThat is not my name\u201d he said, \u201cWhy do you resist us, Locutus, you know what we are capable of\u201d she said. The bridge was quiet as Captain Picard and the Borg queen faced off. \u201cLucky for you, Locutus, we are not interested in you today\u201d said the Borg queen suddenly. \u201cThen what do you want\u201d demanded Picard, coldly. She almost smiled, \u201cCaptain Mark Smith\u201d she said, the words carefully measured for maximum effect. Picard\u2019s gaze swung toward Smith briefly, \u201cAnd if we refuse\u201d said Picard. The Borg queen didn\u2019t answer straight away. After a couple of seconds she said, \u201cDeck 14 is now overrun with drones. If you do not had us Mark Smith, they will force visual and audio imagery of the slow assimilation of your crew until you change your mind\u201d she said. Before Picard could respond, Smith stood, rage filling his thoughts. \u201cYou want me? Fine. Prepare to receive me, but if you want an easy assimilation subject, no if you expect an easy assimilation target then prepare for the biggest resistance you have ever encountered\u201d said Smith. Picard flashed him a steely glare. \u201cYou\u2019re threats are irrelevant, you know I won\u2019t sacrifice a member of my crew\u201d said Picard. Smith shot Picard an equally steely glare, \u201cWith respect, Captain Picard, the lives of the crew aboard this ship are worth more than mine. I lost my ship and all my crew are dead, so I will do anything to protect this ship and this crew\u201d said Smith. Before Picard could respond the Borg queen smiled, that same mechanic, mirthless smile. \u201cNot all of your crew are dead, Captain\u201d she said.

{"text": "  PART 2 Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Captain Mark Smith stood at a critical turning point. The Borg had placed a demand for Captain Smith. Captain Picard knew that handing him over would only mean that the Borg would chase the Enterprise until they recaptured him. Picard also had a hostage situation on deck 14 where the malicious Borg queen had transported scores of drones aboard as leverage to get what they wanted. Picard was trying to maintain control of a hot-headed Captain Smith who wanted to rescue the remnants of his crew. \u201cIf you have my crew, show me\u201d demanded Smith. The Borg queen didn\u2019t respond, other than moving aside to show two drones holding a struggling figure of a woman in the same uniform as him. \u201cMark\u201d came the struggled gasps of the woman. Again Captain Smith fell to his knees as he recognised Lieutenant Commander Alyssa Smith, his wife\u201d. The Borg queen again stepped back into the picture, \u201cWill you join us, Smith\u201d asked the queen, knowing she had the Enterprise crew and Smith backed into a corner. Knowing the situation was beyond him, Smith looked to Picard, \u201cCaptain\u201d he said, resigned and defeated. Picard looked to him, \u201cI cannot allow you to leave this ship, the Borg will just come after us again regardless, but then again, I cannot expect you to abandon your crew\u201d said Picard, \u201cSir, we can\u2019t save them\u201d said Smith, \u201cThe Enterprise is more important\u201d he said. Riker exploded, \u201cHow can you abandon them to assimilation\u201d. Smith glared at him, \u201cI don\u2019t do it easily, Commander, that\u2019s my wife on the screen, but here and now I have a duty as a Starfleet officer\u201d he said. He turned to the screen, \u201cMy love, I\u2019m sorry\u201d he said, head sinking, before turning his attention to the Borg queen, \u201cGo to hell, you skinny mechanic bitch\u201d he growled. The drone holding Lieutenant Commander Smith lifted its hand, injecting the nanites into her blood stream. She screamed, the pain unbearable as the Borg nanites began to alter her. Her scream was not long-lived. Soon only a shell of the former human remained. \u201cLocutus, you will be ours again, Smith, you will make an excellent drone\u201d said the queen, closing the channel. A sniffle escaped Smith. Worf was intently watching the sensors throughout the whole exchange, nothing had really changed until now, \u201cCaptain, Borg weapons systems charging\u201d he said. Picard wasted no time, \u201cHelm, Warp 4, engage\u201d he shouted. The Enterprise leapt away to warp 4. \u201cCaptain, receiving a distress transmission from deck 14\u201d said Worf. Picard stood up, \u201cAre the Borg following us from Earth\u201d he asked. Worf checked the sensors, \u201cYes, Captain, closing at warp 7\u201d said Worf. \u201cIncrease to maximum warp\u201d he said, \u201cLets lead them away from Earth, Mr Worf, scan deck 14, I want to know what\u2019s going on down there\u201d said Picard. Worf worked the sensors, \u201cCaptain, visual contact\u201d said Worf. \u201cOn screen\u201d said Picard. The corridor was dark, drones moved around assimilating crewmembers of the Enterprise. Picard and the Bridge crew watched in horror, \u201cSurvivors\u201d asked Riker. \u201cNone, Commander, all either assimilated or in the process of being assimilated\u201d said Worf. The bridge was silent, \u201cVent deck 14\u201d ordered Picard. The crew rippled, \u201cCaptain\u201d said Commander Riker, \u201cNumber one, venting deck 14 might spare the crew a living hell, I\u2019m doing it to save the Enterprise\u201d said Picard. Worf keyed in the command sequence, \u201cReady, Captain\u201d he said, indicating that the deck was primed for venting. \u201cMake it so, Commander\u201d said Picard. Worf punched it in. \u201cVenting complete, Captain\u201d said Riker, \u201cNothing is alive down there\u201d he finished. The Borg cube pursued the Enterprise relentlessly. The Borg queen was hell bent, if you could consider her hell bent, on capturing Locutus and Captain Smith. The Enterprise was going at maximum cruise speed. She watched as the Enterprise drew closer as the Borg ship was outrunning her. She could picture the resistance that Locutus and Smith would put up as they were assimilated into the Collective. If you could call what she felt pleasure, she had a pleasurable anticipation of the assimilation to come. Back on the Enterprise, Captain Picard watched the Borg ship closing in, \u201cWhat is our current velocity\u201d he asked. \u201cWarp 9.2, Sir\u201d reported Data, \u201cIncrease to Warp 9.8\u201d said Picard. Smith stood up, \u201cCaptain, Warp 9.8 puts the Enterprise at extreme risk, especially given that the Borg are pursuing us\u201d said Captain Smith. Picard looked over at him, \u201cWhat are you suggesting, Mr Smith\u201d he asked. \u201cMr Data, show me a map of the region\u201d said Captain Smith. The map came up at Data\u2019s station. \u201cThere, the Archanis Nebula, if we head there at Warp 9.6, we can be there in about 11 hours. With that Borg cube as badly damaged as it is, it is unlikely that they will be able to go much faster that Warp 9.6\u201d said Smith. Picard nodded, \u201cMake it so\u201d he said, returning to the command chair. The Borg queen experienced something that could be likened to rage and frustration. The Enterprise had increased speed to Warp 9.6 and with the damage caused by the impact with the Lexington meant that the cube could not outpace the Enterprise. The only way they would out run the ship is if they carried on for more than 12 hours and had to drop out of warp. The entire collective consciousness of the Borg was focused on the Enterprise and little more. 10 hours 53 minutes 23 seconds later The Enterprise dropped out of warp and headed into the nebula. Commander Riker stood next to Data\u2019s station, \u201cCaptain, this nebula has a high level of Particle Flux, we can\u2019t stay in here long\u201d he said. Picard nodded, \u201cHow long do we have, Number one\u201d he said, gravely. Riker looked at the screen, \u201c24 minutes, Captain\u201d. \u201cTake us to the edge of the nebula, Mr Worf, prepare a full spread of Photon torpedoes to fire straight into the damaged section of the Borg cube\u201d said Captain Picard. \u201cAye, Sir\u201d said Worf. The Enterprise moved out at half impulse, Worf ready to unleash the Enterprise\u2019s weapons systems on the Borg ship. When they reached the edge of the Nebula, there was no Borg ship. \u201cFull sensor scan\u201d said Picard. Data performed the Scan, \u201cCaptain Smith, please have a look at this information\u201d said Data. Smith had a look, \u201cCaptain, the Borg vessel has set a course for Starbase 245, it looks like it\u2019s just approaching the edge of sensor range, so presume it\u2019s moving at Warp 9.7\u201d said Captain Smith. Picard looked shocked, \u201cBridge to Engineering, Geordi, what is the effect on the warp engines from our prolonged travel at warp 9.6\u201d he said, \u201cWe have to keep power output of the warp engines to a minimum, Captain, I suggest you don\u2019t push her faster than warp 7\u201d  said Geordi LaForge. Picard turned to Data, \u201cMr Data, how soon could we be there at warp 7\u201d he said, \u201c2 hours 28 minutes 45 seconds, Sir\u201d said Data, \u201cHelm, lay in a pursuit course, Engage\u201d said Picard. Starbase 245 Commodore Andre Heston was the base commander of Starbase 245. It was a quiet assignment as Starfleet had always routed invading forces before they approached the base. Today however, they were watching the sensors as they showed a Borg vessel approaching at high warp with no Federation Starships to route it. The Commodore watched as the crew bustled to the final preparations, making sure the weapons and shields were active. \u201cSir, Borg vessel arrival in 2 minutes\u201d said an officer. This was it, the battle was afoot and there was nothing anyone could do about it. Moments later, the gargantuan cube dropped out of warp. Without warning it savagely attacked the Starbase. Within moments officers were reporting shield failures and hull breaches. After a meagre 7 minutes, the station was little more than a debris field. The Borg cube silently moved off, hoping to lure the Enterprise towards them. 2 hours 21 minutes later The USS Enterprise dropped out of warp 50000 kilometres away from the debris field that was Starbase 245. \u201cMy God\u201d said Captain Smith looking at the devastation left in the wake of the Borg. \u201cCaptain, the Borg are trying to lure us into a trap. Judging by the continuing trail away from this site, it is the only conceivable solution\u201d. Riker thought hard, \u201cWe need reinforcements, Captain, but we can\u2019t take the Enterprise back into Federation space. The Borg would just follow\u201d he said. \u201cMr Worf, what is the nearest Starship to our location\u201d he said. Worf checked, \u201cThe Galaxy, Sir\u201d he responded. \u201cOpen a channel\u201d he ordered. Within seconds, the face of Captain Alex Bertrum was on the screen, \u201cCaptain Picard, how can we help you\u201d he said, \u201cWe need to get an officer back to Earth to brief the Council about a Borg invasion. But I can\u2019t take the Enterprise back in to Federation Space, could you rendezvous with us\u201d asked Picard, \u201cCertainly, Captain, set a course to meet us and we will do the same, rendezvous in 3 hours, Galaxy out\u201d  said Captain Bertrum. \u201cHelm, lay in an intercept course and engage at warp 6\u201d said Picard, \u201cAll senior officers, report to the bridge\u201d said Riker. Picard, Riker, Data and Worf walked into the observation lounge. Picard took the seat at the head of the table and waited, the tension palpable between the officers. Moments later, Doctor \u201cCommander\u201d Beverley Crusher, Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge and Councillor \u201cLieutenant Commander\u201d Deanna Troi walked into the briefing room. When they were all seated. \u201cFor those who haven\u2019t met our new crewmate, this is Captain Mark Smith. He commands the Federation Starship Lexington about 30 years from now and was only sent back when he intersected with a temporal distortion\u201d said Picard, introducing Smith. There was a ripple of recognition as they all recognised the 41 year old version of the boy who still regularly saw Councillor Troi and Doctor Crusher. \u201cGood Morning\u201d said Smith, formally to the people who had helped raise him to what he was. \u201cAs you know the Borg are trying to lure this ship into a trap in an attempt to acquire Captain Smith and myself, so we can\u2019t fly back to Earth, without bringing the Borg down on us. So we are setting a course to rendezvous with the USS Galaxy. I will go aboard the Galaxy and we will head back to Earth at maximum warp. Commander Riker and Captain Smith will assume control of the ship, with Captain Smith leading the Borg away\u201d said Picard. Picard turned to Smith, inviting him to talk, \u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy, taking orders from someone you perceive to be a small boy, but I promise you, I will do everything I can to keep this ship safe. I would welcome any suggestions you might have while I\u2019m in Command\u201d said Smith. Picard turned back to the crew, \u201cWe rendezvous with the Galaxy in 3 hours, Captain Smith please stay, the rest of you return to your duties\u201d he said. Captain Smith remained seated alongside Captain Picard. \u201cCaptain, what I\u2019m about to do is dangerous. When I was assimilated by the Borg, they assimilated my thought patterns and its possible that wherever they are they know what I\u2019m planning, or at least they can guess\u201d he said. He looked distant for a moment, and Smith knew what pressure this was putting on the Captain. \u201cI\u2019m going to send a report to the Admiralty explaining who you are, but I\u2019m going to classify it top secret, so you will have to get into a Starfleet uniform like what the crew wears. I also would like you to keep a sensor lock on the USS Galaxy for as long as you can in case the Borg attack. Are you prepared to command my ship, Captain\u201d said Picard, \u201cAye, Sir\u201d said Smith, \u201cComputer, transfer all command functions to Captain Smith, authorization Picard Alpha Tango\u201d said Picard. \u201cThere is no Authorization for Captain Smith, please enter the relevant information\u201d said the computer. \u201cComputer, enter authorization code Smith Zulu five\u201d said Smith, \u201cRegister information under Captain Mark Smith\u201d said Smith. \u201cCommand functions transferred to Captain Mark Smith\u201d said the cool voice of the computer. \u201cThe Enterprise is now your ship, Captain\u201d said Picard. Smith smiled sadly, \u201cThe Enterprise will always be your ship, Captain, I will just be another chapter in hers and your story, Sir\u201d said Captain Smith. 3 hours later The USS Galaxy was holding position just off the starboard bow awaiting Captain Picard\u2019s arrival. \u201cSmith to Transporter room two, is Captain Picard ready to disembark\u201d he said, \u201cYes, Sir, just waiting for confirmation from the Galaxy, Sir\u201d replied Miles O\u2019Brien. Smith settled into his chair and his new uniform. \u201cAs soon as you have confirmation from the Galaxy, beam Captain Picard over\u201d he said, \u201cYes, Sir\u201d said O\u2019Brien. Captain Smith was somewhat uncomfortable. The universe was in a state of temporal flux that none could predict and he and Captain Picard were now right at the centre of things. A single mistake could result in the destruction of the Enterprise, writing the rest of history for the Federation in a completely different manner, it could even destroy the Federation. As the report came in that Captain Picard had been transported to the other ship, Smith ordered that a wide band covariant signal be transmitted on all frequencies and that the ship move away at warp 6. As far as all intelligence aboard the Enterprise, only one Borg vessel had been reported, so that meant they had to keep it busy until Picard could muster the fleet to destroy it.  \u201cCaptain, Borg vessel approaching from heading 232 mark 4\u201d said Worf, his deep voice rumbling across the bridge, \u201cHold your course, Mr Evans\u201d ordered Smith as the crew rippled with unease. \u201cMr Worf, Report\u201d he said  turning to look at his tactical officer. Worf checked the sensors, \u201cBorg vessel is approaching at warp 9.1 , visual contact in ten seconds, its weapons are fully charged\u201d said Worf. Smith sighed, \u201cOn Screen\u201d he said. The image showed a Borg vessel, but it looked to be too small to be a Borg cube. \u201cMagnify\u201d he said. The magnified image showed a Borg sphere, \u201cDamn\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cMr Evans, drop out of warp, Mr Data, contact the Galaxy, warn them that they might be at risk of attack\u201d said Smith. \u201cTime to intercept, 1 minute, 24 seconds\u201d  said Worf. \u201cRed Alert, all hands to battle stations\u201d said Riker. \u201cCaptain, I am unable to raise communications with the Galaxy\u201d said Data. \u201cSensors show a second Borg signal on an intercept course with the Galaxy\u201d said Worf, as the Borg sphere dropped out of warp. \u201cMr Worf, fire a full spread of photons and phasers at a concentrated section of that vessel\u201d he said, \u201cHelm, lay in an intercept course for the USS Galaxy, maximum warp\u201d he said. He watched dispassionately as Worf\u2019s barrage of weapon fire slammed into the Borg vessel, ripping it apart. \u201cHelm, the USS Galaxy, engage\u201d he said, urgency gripping him. The Enterprise jumped to warp. \u201cETA on the Galaxy\u201d he said, \u201c12 minutes, Captain\u201d said the helm officer, \u201cMaintain course and speed\u201d he said, \u201cSenior officers, report to the bridge\u201d said Smith. He turned to Commander Riker, \u201cMr Riker, when we complete this briefing, I want  you and Mr Worf to prepare a fully armed security detail and lead it over to the Galaxy if I see fit\u201d said Smith. \u201cAye, Sir are you expecting trouble\u201d said Riker, \u201cYes, Commander\u201d he turned to Councillor Troi, \u201cCouncillor, what do you imagine the news of an imminent threat to the Federation would do to the crew\u201d he said, \u201c Panic them, and if we are wrong, it would cause resent and the crew would be bristling under your command\u201d said Troi. Smith sighed, \u201cOptions, we are facing a real and present danger from the Borg and I cannot in good consciousness keep them in the dark\u201d he said. Smith wished he had Picard\u2019s wisdom in this situation, \u201cWe are informing the crew, I\u2019ll address them at the proper moment\u201d he said as the bridge turbolift doors hissed open and the senior officers stepped out. \u201cThis is a critical briefing, it will be given to all hands, open internal communications link\u201d he said. He sighed, \u201cAll hands this is the bridge, there is an extreme risk to the Federation. We just lost contact with the USS Galaxy which Captain Picard transferred to in order to warn Earth of the impending Borg attack. We have reason to believe that the Galaxy is under attack from a Borg cube and are therefore setting a course to intercept, I want all stations battle ready in 4 minutes\u201d he said, closing the internal comms. \u201cI need to options. The Enterprise may be out matched by the Borg and I need ways to keep her in the fight. Mr LaForge, Mr Data, work on a way of increasing shields and weapons to compensate for the adaptive nature of the Borg, Commander Riker, Mr Worf, I need tactical strategies in place. Captain Picard may still be in a position where we can rescue him and so we must try to do so. The future of the Federation may depend on it\u201d he said, \u201cDoctor Crusher, Captain Picard may be injured if we can retrieve him, and the battle may cause injuries across the ship, I want your medical teams on full standby\u201d he said as Doctor Crusher nodded her assent. \u201cCouncillor Troi, I need you to remain on the bridge, with the rest of the senior staff off the bridge, I\u2019ll need you to act as my first officer\u201d he said, Troi looked worried, but accepted his orders, \u201cCaptain, we are approaching the USS Galaxy I\u2019m not reading any Borg vessels\u201d said the Helmsman, \u201cSlow to 1/3\u201d he said. \u201cMr Worf, open a channel, we shouldn\u2019t have met the Galaxy so soon\u201d he said. Turning his attention to the Galaxy, he said \u201cEnterprise to Galaxy\u201d. There was no response, \u201cEnterprise to Galaxy, please respond\u201d still nothing, \u201cMr Worf, intensive scan\u201d he said. Worf scanned the Galaxy, \u201cNothing out of the ordinary, Captain\u201d. Then the first shot came. \u201cCaptain, we are being hailed\u201d said Worf, \u201cOn screen\u201d shouted Captain Smith. The Borg queen observed the crew of the USS Enterprise with an almost excited disposition. She knew that they would be demoralized when they saw her, and even more demoralized to see who accompanied her and what she had done to him.  It pleased her to have so many new \u2018children\u2019 in her fold. \u201cYou, what the hell are you playing at\u201d said Captain Smith. \u201cPerfecting the galaxy\u201d replied the queen cryptically. \u201cWhere is Captain Picard\u201d demanded Smith. The bridge crew of the Enterprise were bristling at the appearance of the Borg queen on the USS Galaxy. The Borg queen hadn\u2019t responded to Captain Smith\u2019s question as to the whereabouts of Captain Picard. Suddenly she stepped aside. A figure stepped forward, \u201cI am Locutus of Borg, lower your shields and surrender your ship, resistance is futile\u201d To be continued\u2026  Comments #wpdevar_comment_1 span,#wpdevar_comment_1 iframe{width:100% !important;}Share this:PrintFacebookTwitterPocket     Post a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

{"text": "  PART 3 Captain Mark Alexander Smith stood on the bridge of the USS Enterprise looking at her former Captain. \u201cResistance is futile, lower your shields and surrender your ship. Your culture will adapt to service us\u201d said Locutus, formerly Captain Picard, \u201cNo, we will not surrender, Locutus, you were taken from the Borg by this crew and restored to Captain Picard before\u201d said Captain Smith. \u201cThe unit Picard is part of us, he cannot be removed\u201d said Locutus, \u201cSurrender is the only option\u201d he said. Smith sighed, \u201cCommander, prepare boarding parties to recover Captain Picard\u201d he said, \u201cMr Worf, go with him\u201d he said. Ensign Macaulay stepped up to replace Worf, \u201cEnsign, target the Galaxy shields, Mr Data, do whatever you have to, to keep the Enterprise a step ahead of the Borg\u201d he said. Weapons fire from the Galaxy hit the Enterprise first. The power of the shots quickly overwhelmed the defences, \u201cDamage report\u201d shouted Captain Smith. \u201cMain power is offline\u201d shouted Ensign Macaulay, \u201cShields and Weapons are inoperative, hull integrity down to 74%\u201d shouted Data. \u201cHelm, reverse course, full impulse\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cManifolds can\u2019t handle full impulse, Captain\u201d shouted the helm officer. \u201cCommander LaForge\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cI\u2019ll be in Engineering\u201d replied LaForge. Commander Riker was regaining his feet, \u201cRiker to Bridge, what\u2019s happening\u201d said Riker, tapping his commbadge, \u201cThe Galaxy is attacking, we are taking heavy damage. I\u2019m sorry, Commander, we have to pull back and focus on rescuing Captain Picard another time\u201d said Smith, \u201cUnderstood, Captain\u201d said Riker. He steadied himself against another shot, \u201cMr Worf, what are the odds that the Borg try to board the ship\u201d asked Riker, \u201cHigh, Sir, the Borg only live to assimilate, it is their way\u201d he said, \u201cTake a security detachment and secure main engineering. I\u2019ll take the rest and secure other key areas of the ship\u201d said Riker, \u201cAye, Commander replied Worf. The officers walked in separate directions leading security detachments across the ship. As they went another volley of shots crippled secondary power, \u201cRight, we won\u2019t make it to the bridge, I suggest we head to sickbay and help Doctor Crusher keep the wounded alive and safe\u201d said Riker. The bridge lights exploded, \u201cCaptain, impulse engines are offline\u201d shouted Data, \u201cI\u2019ve lost helm control\u201d shouted the Helm officer, \u201cSecondary power systems are offline\u201d shouted the stand-in tactical officer. The assault stopped, \u201cCaptain, incoming message from the Galaxy, audio only\u201d reported Ensign Macaulay. \u201cLet\u2019s have it\u201d demanded Captain Smith. \u201cWitness the beginning, resistance is futile\u201d said the voice of Locutus. Stardate 48922.81, Starfleet Headquarters, San Francisco Vice Admiral John Adamson was looking at the report given to him by Captain Michael Thornton, Commanding Officer of the USS Akira. \u201cCaptain, I want an account of everything\u201d said the Admiral, \u201cSir, about 4 hours ago, we lost contact with the Starships Enterprise and Galaxy. Our sensors picked up massive amounts of weapons fire as well as Borg signatures. When everything died down, we detected a starship but we could not open a line of communication. Intensive scans showed it to be the Enterprise, she was maintaining position when we moved back to transmission range. Admiral, we are the only other starship within 4 days of the Enterprise, if the Borg are gathering forces in this area, we need more ships\u201d said Captain Thornton. \u201cUnderstood, Captain, you are to hold your position on the edge of the sector until reinforcements arrive. Monitor the Neutral Zone for any signs of the Romulans taking advantage of the weakened state of the Enterprise, Adamson Out\u201d he said. He turned away from the viewscreen feeling uneasy. As the head of Fleet operations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard had filed a report about Captain Smith, and the position Picard was assigning him. With the Galaxy and Picard MIA and a heavy Borg presence being noted, along with the destruction of Starbase 245, the Admiral was becoming concerned with the security of the Federation. \u201cDamn it, we were attacked 4 hours ago, Locutus could be anywhere by now and we have no way of contacting Starfleet\u201d snapped Captain Smith, in what was left of Starboard observation. \u201cMr LaForge, status of the Engines\u201d he said, \u201cWe think we have thrusters back, Captain, we need to test them before we can bring Impulse and Warp power back online\u201d he said. He nodded, his temper subsiding slightly. \u201cMr Data, how are the sensors\u201d he said, \u201cWe can only use short range sensors at the present time. All long range sensors have been destroyed\u201d he said. Smith\u2019s head dropped, \u201cFind a way to reroute long range sensors through the short range sensor arrays, then transfer all power from the long range arrays back into shields and weapons. Mr LaForge, assist Mr Data when we are sure about the status of the Engines\u201d he said. Riker pitched in, \u201cCaptain, Doctor Crusher is requesting that anyone with a level 2 medical qualification assist her teams in triage\u201d he said. \u201cGive her all the help she needs\u201d ordered Smith. He turned his attention to Worf, \u201cWhat about weapons\u201d he said, \u201cThe phasers are being repaired as we speak. The torpedo firing system is online\u201d he said. Smith sighed, \u201cVery well, dismissed, prepare for engine trials\u201d he said, joining the officers as they stepped onto the bridge. \u201cHelm, forward thrusters to 50%, port and starboard at station keeping\u201d he said. The thrusters activated, seemingly without fault, \u201cLaForge to Bridge, Captain, the thrusters repairs are complete, I can give you partial impulse in 10 minutes and partial warp in 15 minutes\u201d  said LaForge. Exhausted with the fatigue of defeat, Captain Smith turned to Councillor Troi, the most senior officer on the bridge at that time, \u201cCouncillor, you have the bridge, alert me if we run across the Galaxy\u201d he said, walking into his ready room as Councillor Troi sat in the command chair. After a few hours of restlessness, he was thrown to the floor as an explosion rocked the ship. \u201cReport\u201d he said. Walking out onto the bridge, \u201cRomulans\u201d was the only reply, \u201cOpen a channel\u201d ordered Smith. The stand in tactical officer was doing so, \u201cNo response, Captain\u201d. Smith pondered, in his time, the Romulans were allies, he even had Romulan friends, but where he was now, they would attack and they would not consider being friends. They wanted a ship like the Enterprise.  \u201cBack us off, use thrusters and impulse engines to get us inside that proto-stellar nebula\u201d ordered Smith. \u201cCaptain, if we go in there, we will be cornered, if the Romulans leave, the Borg will just take their place\u201d said Ensign Macaulay. \u201cAgreed, very well, Ensign, helm go to warp 1 and get us away from Romulan space\u201d ordered the Captain. The Enterprise repairs were going well, after 15 hours, weapons and shields were at 94% while Data and LaForge had managed to enhance the short range sensor arrays with long range equipment. Impulse engines had been fully repaired and Commander LaForge was preparing to unlock the magnetic constrictors and allow the full use of the warp drive. Commander Riker had returned to the bridge, but he had left security details at main engineering and sickbay ready for any Borg incursions. They were both sat in their chairs at the centre of the bridge. \u201cCaptain, our long range sensors have picked up unusual readings, I went to Stellar Cartography and ran a Quantum Spectral Analysis. The signatures are Borg, in about 3 days, the Viridian and Ceridian systems will be overwhelmed\u201d said Riker, \u201cI contacted Starfleet and forwarded the date I had, they are marshalling all ships to Sector 221 to engage, but I also found the Galaxy\u201d he said. Smith looked at Riker, \u201cWhere is she\u201d he said. Riker pulled up the data on a PADD. \u201cThe Goren sector, approaching Earth at maximum warp, accompanied by 2 Borg scout-ships\u201d said Riker with a sigh. Smith looked at the data, \u201cWhat\u2019s their ETA\u201d he said quietly. Riker looked at the information, \u201c20 days 4 hours at maximum warp, Sir\u201d said Riker. He stood slowly, \u201cCaptain, we have also been hailed by Admiral Rogers, we have been ordered to meet with the fleet at the edge of Sector 221\u201d reported Data, \u201cI can\u2019t get a stable communications line due to interference from a plasma storm in that area\u201d he reported. \u201cHelm, lay in an intercept course for the Galaxy, warp 4.8\u201d ordered Smith. The helm officer shot a look at Data, \u201cCourse plotted, Captain\u201d reported the officer. \u201cEngage\u201d replied Smith, \u201cRed alert\u201d he finished, \u201cCommander, I apologize, but hopefully this is an opportunity to rescue Captain Picard before he is destroyed. The timeline relies on it, so disregard any and all Starfleet Protocols. Submit the situation in your report\u201d he said. Turning to the helm officer he said, \u201cEnsign, ETA on the Galaxy\u201d. The helm officer looked back, \u201cAt this speed 15 hours, but if we can get to maximum warp, I can do that in less than 4 hours\u201d she said. Smith nodded, \u201cSmith to LaForge\u201d he said, tapping his communicator. \u201cLaForge here\u201d replied Lieutenant Commander LaForge. \u201cCommander, can you have the constrictors unlocked in 1 hour\u201d he asked, \u201cYes, Captain, I\u2019m just finishing the preparation procedure, it\u2019ll be done in about 20 minutes\u201d reported LaForge. \u201cAcknowledged\u201d he said. Meanwhile, on Earth, \u201cAdmiral, we have just got a long range sensor report from the USS Rhode Island. We are seeing a ship that appears to be the USS Galaxy as well as the USS Enterprise\u201d reported a Vulcan Commander. Admiral Robertson looked at the report, \u201cWhat is the heading of the Galaxy\u201d he asked. \u201cThey are on a direct course for sector 001, the Enterprise is on an intercept course\u201d reported the Commander, \u201cGet me the Enterprise\u201d ordered the Admiral. Minutes later, the Enterprise bridge was on his monitor. \u201cAdmiral, what\u2019s the situation\u201d asked Commander Riker. \u201cWhere is Captain Smith\u201d he said, remembering the report of Picard and the Galaxy crew being assimilated. \u201cOn his way, Admiral\u201d replied Riker. \u201cCommander, what the hell is going on\u201d said Admiral Robertson. \u201cThe Galaxy is making a direct run at Sector 001 while the fleet is engaged at Sector 221. They have Borg escorts, we are pursuing in the hopes of recovering Captain Picard, the future of the Federation may depend on it\u201d said Riker. \u201cDo you require assistance, I can have ships meet you in 3 days\u201d said the Admiral, \u201cNot necessary, Admiral, the fleet will be needed where they are\u201d. The Admiral nodded, \u201cRobertson Out\u201d he said. An hour later, the Enterprise was travelling at Warp 9.6 in an attempt to intercept the Galaxy and Captain Picard. The ship was only 2 and a half hours out travelling at current speeds. \u201cI want shields set to rotating harmonics, weapons set to high-end EM frequencies, prepare anti-matter spreads to confuse their sensors. All emergency and secondary power to shields, reduce lighting in all areas of the ship to 15% and divert that energy to the weapons\u201d ordered Captain Smith. \u201cReduce all non essential systems to minimal requirements and hold that energy in reserve\u201d ordered Riker. 2 hours later The darkened bridge was comforting for Captain Smith. He was used to the bridge dimming at red alert to divert power to the weapons and shields, it felt like normal to have a darkened bridge again. \u201cCaptain, the Galaxy has altered course to intercept but its escorts are continuing on course to Sector 001\u201d reported Worf. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Galaxy\u2019s new course\u201d asked Smith, \u201c334 Mk 114, an intercept course\u201d he reported. \u201cEntering visual range\u201d said Data, \u201cOn screen\u201d ordered Riker. The Galaxy looked different. Borg devices were appearing on the hull, the nacelles were glowing green rather than blue. The ship was a Borg ship all over. \u201cTime to intercept 2 minutes 14 seconds\u201d reported the helm officer. Smith and Riker shared a glance, \u201cBattle Stations\u201d they said, in unison. The bridge was silent with anticipation, \u201cSlow to half impulse\u201d ordered Smith, \u201cReady phasers, load photon torpedoes\u201d he continued. \u201cCaptain, the Galaxy is dropping out of warp 5000 km dead ahead\u201d said Worf. Data was looking at the sensors, \u201cCaptain, I\u2019m reading an increase of protons emanating from the Galaxy deflector dish\u201d reported Data. \u201cProton emissions\u201d questioned the Captain, confused. A sudden realisation hit him, \u201cRotate shield harmonics to compensate for Proton bursts\u201d shouted the Captain as the first burst slammed the ship, \u201csparks erupted and the ship shook heavily, \u201cShield rotations having no effect\u201d shouted Worf, \u201c5 EPS conduits ruptured in Engineering, they have massive casualties\u201d shouted another officer. \u201cSmith to Engineering, Commander, I need a way to block these proton bursts\u201d shouted Smith, \u201cI got nothing, Captain, they are disrupting power systems, I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d said LaForge, \u201cBrace for impact\u201d shouted Worf as another burst hit the ship. The crew were again thrown to the floor, \u201cCaptain, shields are completely ineffective\u201d shouted Worf, \u201cNo activity in the main weapons array on their ship, or ours\u201d shouted Worf, \u201cHelm, move us away\u201d ordered Smith, \u201cAye, Sir\u201d shouted the helm officer. \u201cLaForge to Bridge, we have a new problem, you need to stop using the impulse engines, we\u2019re burning Deuterium down here, were gunna blow our nacelles up, we won\u2019t need any help from the Borg\u201d came the shout of Commander LaForge. He considered, \u201cHold her together. I\u2019ll reduce speed to \u00be\u201d said Captain Smith. Another burst slammed the ship, \u201cCaptain, starboard nacelle is fused, there is a plasma leak in that nacelle\u201d reported the helm officer. Another burst slammed the ship, \u201cCaptain, weapon interlocks destroyed, primary and secondary systems destroyed\u201d shouted Worf. \u201cReinforcing the structural integrity grid may buy time\u201d said Data. \u201cMake it so, Commander\u201d shouted. \u201cBridge, this is Ensign Johnny Saunders, I need a clear evacuation rout for the children. There are 34 families on board presently and I have about 40 kids here\u201d came an urgent call. Knowing that he had a younger version of himself aboard he knew he had to save the kids, \u201cCommander Riker, you have the bridge, I need to get them kids\u201d he said. \u201cYes, Captain\u201d said Riker, in no mood to argue as another shot slammed the ship. Captain Smith grabbed a phaser, as he left the bridge he heard Worf shout, \u201cCommander, Shield power relays taking heavy damage, Internal sensors are failing, but showing 20 Borg on every deck below deck 10, you won\u2019t make it to deck 20, that\u2019s where Ensign Saunders\u2019 signal came from\u201d he said addressing the Captain. \u201cI intend to try, Commander, transmit orders for ALL crewmen to arm up\u201d he said. \u201cAye, Captain\u201d said Riker. Just as he prepared to enter the turbolift a burst slammed the ship. \u201cCaptain, Main power offline, not enough secondary for turbolift operation\u201d shouted Worf. The Captain instantly went to the Jeffries tubes, \u201cCommander, seal the bridge when I pass the bulkhead\u201d he ordered. Riker simply nodded. 5 minutes later, Captain Smith hit a blockage in the tube at deck 6. He kicked through a damaged panel. \u201cSmith to Bridge, Commander, I\u2019m running deck to deck on foot\u201d he said, tapping his communicator. \u201cCopy that, Captain, the Galaxy is holding position. No more activity\u201d reported Riker. \u201cAcknowledged, reinforce structural integrity grid and polarize the hull, divert power from shields and weapons if you have to, cut impulse engines\u201d he ordered. \u201cAye, Captain\u201d said Riker, \u201cSmith Out\u201d said the Captain. After another 5 minutes Smith was on Deck 14. He had climbed into a turbolift shaft and made a rudimentary rappel and fast roped down to the turbolift that was on deck 14. As he forced the door. He saw Borg working on the Enterprise and her crew. \u201cSmith to Saunders, I\u2019m on deck 14, ETA 5 minutes, Smith Out\u201d he said. He holstered his Phaser, he didn\u2019t want to provoke the Borg. He was looking for another access point. He wanted to jump the last 6 decks like had jumped to deck 14. He found it. As soon as he forced the door, the Borg turned towards him. He jumped down again and the door shut behind him. \u201cSmith to Saunders, I\u2019m on the deck, which section are you on\u201d he said. \u201cHead to section 3, Sir, Saunders out\u201d, the Captain moved on. Soon he was in section 3. He forced the door and stepped into a phaser in the face. \u201cEasy there, Ensign\u201d said Smith. Another proton burst slammed the Enterprise followed by another 2. Smith sealed the door as the corridor outside the room collapsed. On the bridge, Worf picked himself up, looking at the rest of the bridge crew. \u201cReport\u201d said Riker. \u201cLast internal scan showed a collapse in section 3 of Deck 20. There are 900 micro-fractures in the hull and 14 hull breaches, the Borg have repaired long range sensors and routed the Long range sensor data and all stellar cartography data with full detail as to all ships in Starfleet, the Borg fleet and the Klingon fleet to the bridge. Communications are down, weapons and shields are inoperative. Main power is offline, secondary power is at 23% and is barely sustaining life support\u201d reported Worf. Riker looked around, \u201cShut down all lighting except alert lighting and divert the power to the life support systems\u201d ordered Riker, \u201cGet repair teams on those micro-fractures and have Geordi work on getting sub-space communications back\u201d said Riker. \u201cDisplay data being given by the Borg\u201d said Riker. They were not aware of how the Borg were working such an angle. \u201cMr Data, how could the Borg go from emotionless to working an emotionally motivated attack. They have a concept of morale and human emotions, they are wearing our morale down\u201d said Riker, \u201cI do not know, Commander\u201d. Riker sighed, \u201cOk, what are we looking at Data\u201d said Riker. Data looked at the data, \u201c500 ships are at the edge of the Viridian system trying box in a Borg invasion force. There are 42 anomalies open in the Viridian System. Starfleet is overwhelmed, Commander\u201d reported Data. The bridge crew watched the dots moving around on the screen, each signifying hundreds, even thousands of lives desperately fighting for their lives. The only sound to pierce the silence of the smashed bridge of the Enterprise, was the crackling of flames, and the explosion of sparks from damaged consoles. To Be Continued\u2026.

{"text": "  PART 4 Commander William Riker watched the battle unfolding on the battered bridge of the Enterprise. \u201cBegin repairs, we need to find the Captain and get out of here\u201d he said. Captain Smith had ran off to rescue a group of children trapped when the Borg boarded the ship. The Borg, supremely confident in their ability only sent 20 Borg per deck below deck 10. The Captain was trapped down there now as well. Riker looked to Data, \u201cMr Data, you have the bridge, what\u2019s left of it anyway\u201d he said, walking into the ready room. There was a morbid atmosphere on the bridge, they had just been watching the defeat of a combined force of 100 ships, Federation and Klingon, and been slammed out of the fight by the USS Galaxy, a former Federation vessel now commanded by the assimilated former Captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard. Riker sighed and picked up a chair in the ready room, returning it to its rightful place behind the desk. On deck 20, Captain Mark Smith sat slumped against a wall in the room where he had rushed to try and save the children trapped down there. All he felt was a profound sense of failure. When he had arrived in this time and learned that the Borg were breaking through, he set himself against the Borg, vowing to save the Federation and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant the same pain they were going through in his time. But through his efforts, Captain Picard had been re-assimilated by the Borg, the entire crew of the USS Galaxy had shared the same fate. The fleet had been engaged in battle with hundreds of Borg vessels in the Viridian system, and he had no idea what had happened to them. The Ensign who had sent the distress call in the first place was scanning the door that the Captain had sealed, \u201cCaptain, the Borg are leaving the door for the moment. Orders\u201d he said. \u201cGet some rest, Ensign, to get out of here, we are gunna need it\u201d he said. The Ensign nodded and went over to the wall by the door and sat down, exhausted. The Captain went back to self pity, knowing it was useless, but at that particular moment he didn\u2019t care. A small boy interrupted his train of thought, \u201cHi\u201d said the boy nervously. In the dark Smith couldn\u2019t see who it was, \u201cWell hi there, kid\u201d smiled the Captain, instantly hiding his true feelings, \u201cYou ok\u201d he asked looking at the boy, \u201cNo, I\u2019m scared\u201d replied the child. The Captain looked at the boy, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name son\u201d he said gently, \u201cMark\u201d replied the child solemnly. Realization hit the Captain, \u201cMark Smith\u201d he said, \u201cYes\u201d said the younger version of himself, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name\u201d asked the boy curiously, \u201cCaptain Mark Smith\u201d replied the Captain. \u201cWow, you have the same name as me\u201d said the boy, \u201cActually, I am you\u201d said the Captain, ignoring the temporal prime directive. The young Mark Smith was confused, \u201cMe\u201d he said, \u201cYes, kid, I\u2019m you from the future, so why are you scared\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Borg\u201d replied the child with a shiver. \u201cWell they are very scary\u201d agreed Captain Smith, gently patting the floor next to him. The child sat down, \u201cThey want to get us\u201d said the child sadly. The Captain looked at him, \u201cYes\u201d he said, \u201cThey want to get us\u201d. The boy looked at him, eyes full of fear, \u201cWill they\u201d he asked. The Captain looked down on him, softly, \u201cNo, they will not get us if I can help it\u201d said the Captain, \u201cBut to make sure they don\u2019t get us, I need your help\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cI need you to be my brave little officer\u201d said the Captain, smiling at all the children who had gathered around him. \u201cAll of you can be my brave little officers\u201d he said. Looking around, he could see they were not convinced. \u201cHere we go\u201d said the Captain, reaching up to his collar and removing a pip, \u201cMark, I\u2019m going to need a first officer\u201d he said, putting the pip on the boys collar. \u201cYou there, what\u2019s your name\u201d said the Captain. \u201cAlex\u201d said the child. Smith smiled, \u201cThe Klingons would say that is a strong name, how would you like to be my security officer\u201d he smiled. The child laughed softly, momentarily forgetting his fear, Ensign Saunders watched, laughing softly as well. Captain Smith clipped the second pip to the second young boy. He looked around, searchingly, \u201cWho is good at science\u201d he said. A couple of children put their hands up, \u201cOk, you\u201d he said closing his eyes and pointing. A boy of about 12 stepped forward, \u201cYou are my new science officer\u201d he said putting the third pip on the boys collar. Now I need to give a last pip, but what should they be an officer of, thought the Captain. Then he got it, \u201cNow, who has the best eyesight\u201d asked the Captain. All the kids pointed at a boy in the middle, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy\u201d asked the Captain, kindly. \u201cJohn\u201d said the boy, \u201cI name you, Chief look out\u201d smiled the Captain, giving the last of his pips away. He looked at the remaining kids, \u201cNow, the rest of you have a job just as important as the others\u201d he said, \u201cI need you all to be the eyes and ears for me and Ensign Saunders\u201d he said, \u201cCan you do that\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cYeah\u201d said the children. The Captain laughed, \u201cRight, bedtime then, a crew need s a good sleep before a mission\u201d said the Captain. Within minutes, the children were all asleep, and Captain Smith and Ensign Saunders were agreeing on a watch rota to make sure the Borg didn\u2019t catch them by surprise. After the group had slept for a long time to get their strength up, the Captain was ready to start his push to evacuate the children. He tested internal communications, tapping his communicator, \u201cSmith to Bridge, is anyone there\u201d said the Captain, \u201cCaptain, we had no idea you made it, internal communications failed shortly after your last conversation with Ensign Saunders\u201d said an elated Commander Riker. The Captain smiled, in such a short time he had earned the respect of the crew, \u201cCommander, are the turbolifts working yet, I need to get the children off the decks where the Borg are\u201d he said, \u201cYes, Captain, turbolifts are operational again\u201d replied Riker. \u201cWhat about transporters\u201d he asked, \u201cThey should be repaired soon, we have internal sensors back so I can keep a lock on you and if the transporters come online I can beam you out\u201d said Commander Riker, \u201cAcknowledged, Smith out\u201d said the Captain. 10 minutes later, the scared group silently crept through deck 20, looking for the turbolift. They found themselves at a corridor with a turbolift at the end, \u201cEnsign\u201d whispered the Captain, \u201cTake them to the turbolift, I\u2019ll hold at this position until you are all in\u201d he whispered, as the Ensign crept up beside him, \u201cYes, Sir\u201d said the Ensign, ushering the children along the corridor. That\u2019s when things started going wrong, Borg came out of nowhere from either side of the corridor section. He fired his phaser at them, taking a couple down, but they were quick to adapt, he smoothly changed the setting and fired again. He heard a shout behind him, \u201cCaptain, come on\u201d shouted Ensign Saunders. The Captain turned and ran. As he ran past a door, it hissed open and a strong vice-like hand grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. Saunders began to leave the lift, \u201cGet back, Ensign\u201d shouted the Captain, struggling with the drone. He turned and punched it in the face. As he struggled with the first drone, he didn\u2019t notice the second drone come out of another door, until it grabbed him, \u201cGet out of here, that\u2019s an order\u201d shouted the Captain, as Borg swarmed towards the lift. The last sight they got of the Captain was him struggling in the grip of 2 drones, with about 40 drones rushing towards them. As the lift smoothly ascended Saunders tapped his communicator. On the bridge, Commander Riker was monitoring the repair efforts, when the call came through, \u201cSaunders to bridge\u201d he said, \u201cRiker here\u201d replied the Commander, \u201cSir, we are in the lift, the children are safe. I regret to inform you, Captain Smith was apprehended by the Borg\u201d said the Ensign, \u201cUnderstood, Ensign, Riker out\u201d. The crew looked extremely demoralized, \u201cCommander we are being hailed\u201d said Worf, \u201cOn Screen\u201d said Riker. \u201cWe have your Captain, lower your shields and surrender your ship, you will adapt to service us\u201d said the Borg queen. Riker saw drones dragging Smith onto the assimilated bridge of the Galaxy, \u201cDon\u2019t surrender, Commander, that\u2019s an order\u201d he shouted. \u201cAcknowledged, Captain. Don\u2019t you surrender either, Sir\u201d said Riker. \u201cAcknowledged\u201d said the Captain. The queen smiled, \u201cWhy do you resist us, we only want to help you achieve perfection\u201d she said, almost petulantly, \u201cI happen to like myself just the way I am\u201d said Riker. The queen looked at him, \u201cBut you are an imperfect being and we are the height of perfection\u201d she said. Riker looked at her pointedly, \u201cBelieving oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind\u201d he said, \u201cEnterprise out\u201d he said, cutting her off before she could respond. But the image remained. She was forcing the communication through the Enterprise computer. That was how they saw Captain Smith break free of the Borg drones, knocking them over like bowling pins. He ran forward across the bridge, and dived at the Borg queen. He quickly snapped her neck, severing the tenuous balance between machine and organic components. That should have been the end of it, but the Borg had adapted as soon as the future cube came through an anomaly and established communication with the collective in this time. As the queen dropped dead, the Borg collective fell under the control of Locutus, who Captain Smith couldn\u2019t kill for the danger of killing Captain Picard. He jumped across the bridge and deactivated the Picard drone and grabbed his communicator. Luckily for him, deactivating Locutus caused a temporary disturbance in the collective. He looked at the screen, \u201cLock onto my communicator while they are disrupted and beam him out of here\u201d he said, slapping the commbadge onto the drones chest. The drone vanished from the bridge. \u201cCaptain, the Galaxy\u2019s shields have been raised again, we can\u2019t lock onto you\u201d reported Commander Riker. The Captain ran to the tactical station. He looked around and found a phaser compartment underneath it. Quickly tapping the buttons on the small hand held weapon he turned it on the Borg and opened fire on the few drones on the bridge. \u201cI\u2019m locking out the main bridge, that should give me some control of the ship\u201d said Smith. He checked the status, of the systems, \u201cDamn, they managed to reroute shield controls before I locked them out\u201d said Smith. A beeping came from the sensors, \u201cCommander, does the Enterprise have any propulsion systems\u201d said Captain Smith. \u201cYes, we have thrusters, but we aren\u2019t going anywhere without you, Sir\u201d said Riker. The Captain smiled, \u201cCommander, you have the Captain, and I\u2019m not supposed to be in this time period, if I remain, who knows how I could damage the future\u201d said Smith, revealing something he had already been planning. \u201cSave Picard, I\u2019ll save the Alpha Quadrant\u201d he said. As if to drive the point home, the Borg cube dropped out of warp. \u201cCommander, lower the energy signature of the Enterprise, they shouldn\u2019t register you\u201d said the Captain, alone on the assimilated Galaxy\u2019s bridge. \u201cThe Borg are conducting an intensive scan, they have lost the signal of both Captain Picard and the Borg queen\u201d reported Worf. Riker nodded, \u201cData, have they detected us\u201d he said, heavily. Data checked the sensors, \u201cThere is no indication that they have detected us, Commander\u201d said Data. \u201cHelm, move us away, full thrusters\u201d ordered Commander Riker, reluctantly. \u201cPut the Galaxy on screen\u201d he said, taking the chair on the bridge that was previously occupied by Captain Picard or Captain Smith, 2 men who he had come to respect. On the Galaxy, Captain Smith was playing with the weapons and propulsion systems. He was targeting the Borg vessel. He started to work the firing. Within seconds he was pitting Borg technology against Borg technology. The Galaxy was firing on the Borg cube, but the Borg cube was battling back hard. The Captain could see instantly that he was outmatched. The ship was slammed around under the brutal assault of the Borg cube. Sparks were flying everywhere as the ship was slowly being torn apart. In a few short minutes, Smith had watched his shields reduced to 15%, his weapons were losing power and the warp core containment field was losing integrity. He was thrown to the floor as another shot slammed the ship. The shields were destroyed and the weapons failed. The sound of a critical alert filled the bridge. \u201cSmith to Enterprise, it\u2019s been a real experience\u201d he said. \u201cYou too, Captain, good luck\u201d came back Commander Riker.  Captain Smith went to the propulsion console, the ship was counting down to a warp core breach. He plotted a course at warp speed, straight at the Borg cube and engaged. As the Galaxy jumped to warp speed, the crew of the Enterprise observed a flash of metal as the ship covered the distance in seconds. The Borg cube began to tear itself apart under the stress from the impact. The day had been won. But at a heavy price. 6 years later Cadet Mark Smith stood with the Enterprise crew in the Starfleet Auditorium. It was the sixth anniversary of the Borg invasion, where Captain Picard had been assimilated and the Galaxy crew along with him. Cadet Smith glanced down the row of the crew and saw Captain Picard standing sombrely at the end of the row, alongside an Admiral whose name he couldn\u2019t remember and Commander Riker. The Admiral was addressing the assembled crowd of Klingons and Starfleet officers. \u201cThe honoured dead fought for freedom from the Borg 6 years ago and they paid the highest price. A combined loss of nearly 10000 men and women serving in the Klingon and Federation fleets. Today we honour their sacrifice and the sacrifice made by the crew of each ship to survive the Battle of Viridian. To name the honoured would take me another 6 years, and therefore I regret that I can only name a few. The interim Captain of the Enterprise, Captain Mark Alexander Smith, put in command by Captain Picard before an attempt at an ambitious plan to rally Starfleet and her allies. General M\u2019Tath of the Klingon 1st  Battle Group\u201d. The Admiral went on naming the honoured dead, but Cadet Smith was thinking of just 1. Captain Mark Smith. The man he had spoken to in the darkened interior of the Enterprise. The man who despite his own apparent fears comforted children he had never met. The man who had showed him the true potential of himself. Of course, subtle changes had to be made to records, Cadet Smith now went by the name Mark Smith Jr and the records showed his father died when he slammed the USS Galaxy into a Borg cube. But other than that, Captain Mark Alexander Smith\u2019s mission to stop the Borg causing unimaginable damage to the timelines and the future had been completely successful. There had been no sign of Borg activity since the ships self destructed and he had even fallen in love with a young woman called Alyssa May. As far as Cadet Smith was concerned life was good.

{"text": "   Star Trek Return Fire Episode One: \u201cEarl Grey, Hot\u201d Bernard Schaffer Edited by Laurie Laliberte  1. Earl Grey, Hot   The professor looked out over the crowd of eager cadets and waited for silence.  They were the best and they knew it.  Starfleet Academy\u2019s top students, best performers, highest decorated.  The boys in the front were strong and decided-looking, sitting with their arms flexed just enough that their biceps bulged against their uniforms, hoping one of the few females seated nearby was looking. The girls looked more focused.  They were the ones with something to prove, Wesley Crusher thought.  They were the ones who wanted revenge.      \u201cMay I continue?\u201d Wesley said.  He balanced himself on his good leg to lean back against his podium and stroked his full, gray beard, making eye contact with as many of them as he could.  \u201cThis next block is probably the most difficult of all the ones I teach.  It causes more controversy than anything else you\u2019ll learn during your time here, and probably with good reason.  It\u2019s also the one we get the most complaints about from parents,\u201d he added with a wry smile. \u201cYou see, Starfleet has a way of lying to its young cadets.\u201d He let that one sink in for a minute, watching how the class shifted uneasily in their seats.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come right out and say it, of course, but your entire curriculum, this entire facility, and the whole of Starfleet Command, has a way of propagating this myth about what you\u2019ll experience in space.  It\u2019s all about adventure, right?  It\u2019s all about seeking out brave new worlds, etcetera, etcetera.  Nobody signed up to be a requisitions officer, did you?\u201d  He scanned the room with his finger and said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think so.  You want to be a captain!  You want to be an explorer.  Right?\u201d Some of the students nodded, and Wesley folded his hands behind his back.  His professor\u2019s robe was getting tight around his middle.  The excuse he gave his doctor was that he wasn\u2019t really becoming a saggy old man; it was simply the effects of the Earth\u2019s gravity on him after spending his adolescent years in space.  He lifted his head and said, \u201cWho here thinks they might die in service?\u201d Nobody moved.  \u201cStatistics prior to the Great Invasion say that twelve percent of all Starfleet Officers would either die or be critically injured in the course of their duties.  Obviously, we cannot accurately factor what those statistics were during the Invasion.  The casualty rate, particularly for women, was appallingly high during that period.  I am certain that many of you were already aware of this sad fact.\u201d He looked at them, studying their faces.  Now he had their attention.  \u201cLet me ask you this instead.  If you were going to die while in service to Starfleet, how would it be?\u201d \u201cIn battle,\u201d the young man nearest to him said.  \u201cKilling Borg.\u201d There were many murmurs of agreement to that and Wesley nodded, \u201cUnderstandable.  But the Delta Quadrant is far away and the Hive has not dared cross the border in decades.  What else besides battle might take your young lives?\u201d \u201cTransporter malfunction,\u201d someone else said. \u201cAlien disease.\u201d \u201cAll tragically real possibilities,\u201d Wesley said.  He activated a large holographic projection of a starship travelling through space.  \u201cThis is classified footage of the USS Janeway Event.  You will never see it again unless you wind up working for Starfleet Intelligence.  The Janeway was on a routine mission to the Alpha Quadrant when a series of misfortunes struck.\u201d  Wesley paused the image and aimed a bright red light on the ship\u2019s nacelles.  The image started to move again in slow motion, going frame by frame, so that the explosion in the ship started as a small crack along its surface with bright yellow flame beneath it.  As Wesley advanced the frames, the ship blew to pieces directly in front the class.  \u201cFifteen hundred people onboard.  Men, women and children.  Fifteen hundred lives, here one moment, thinking about their work, their families, their problems, their lives.  Working, eating, arguing, making love, sleeping, and all the things you can imagine happen at any given time on board a vessel, gone like that,\u201d Wesley said with a snap of his fingers.  \u201cNot in battle.  Not saving some civilization.  A failed reactor coil.\u201d The faces looked a little less confident now.  Wesley ended the projection and said, \u201cStill, mass tragedies like the Janeway are big events.  There\u2019s media coverage and boards of inquiry.  But large scale incidents are not the only kind that happen.  Not by a long shot.\u201d He pressed a button on his console and the shimmering hologram of a dark-skinned, bald-headed man appeared before the class.  His Starfleet captain\u2019s uniform was so perfectly detailed, Wesley could see the fabric patterns on his shirt sleeves.  \u201cThis is Captain Benjamin Sisko, one year before he led the attack on the Dominion fleet at Cardassian Prime.  By all accounts, Captain Sisko was an exemplary commanding officer and probably candidate for the Admiralty.\u201d Wesley paused in front of the hologram, looking into its deeply set eyes, admiring its proud gaze.  \u201cDuring his assignment to Deep Space Nine, Sisko was contacted by an alien species that occupied a nearby wormhole.  These beings would often remove Sisko from our dimension and place him inside their own, completely at their own whim.  Finally, they decided to keep him.\u201d  Wesley looked over his shoulder at the audience, \u201cHis command, his son, his pregnant wife, and everything he knew was left behind, without any warning.  Sisko appeared in a vision to his wife and told her he expected to return in a year, that the Prophets, as they wished to be known, had much to teach him.\u201d The next hologram showed a shriveled man being wheeled in front of the class, pushed by another of the Academy\u2019s professors.  Wesley stood in the same place he had twenty years before, on the day the hologram was recorded, and the image of Miles O\u2019Brien nodded at Wesley as it walked past.  O\u2019Brien\u2019s hologram pushed the withered man to a place in front of the class, then turned and walked away.  Wesley glanced at the corner of the room where one of the cadets sat, a young man with startlingly green eyes that slanted ever so slightly at the corners as evidence of his Asian heritage.  Liam O\u2019Brian looked up as his grandfather walked past him to leave the classroom, his eyes never leaving the shimmering image until it vanished. Wesley walked up to the hologram sitting in its wheelchair at the front of his class and clasped his hands behind his back, making sure all of the students were looking.  It was uncomfortable for them, that much was certain.  Benjamin Sisko was an invalid whose limbs were bone-thin and curled up close to his body compulsively.  His head drooped to the side and long streams of drool spilled out of his open mouth that contained no teeth. \u201cNineteen years later, this is what returned to Deep Space Nine.  By that point, no one who had served with the Captain remained aboard or had any idea he might someday return as suddenly as he left.  He\u2019d been declared dead by the Federation and his wife had already remarried and moved halfway across the galaxy.  My colleague, the late Professor O\u2019Brien, whom you just saw in the hologram came upon a posting on the Engineer\u2019s network regarding the matter and immediately recognized his former Captain.\u201d  Wesley looked out over the class, \u201cBenjamin Sisko lingered in the state you see him in for another five years in a Federation hospital.\u201d One of the girls in the front row raised her hand, \u201cWhy did the Prophets want him?\u201d Wesley shrugged, \u201cWe will never be certain.  At the time, Captain Sisko thought he was destined to fulfill their grand scheme, and in some ways, he may have been.  The whole story is never quite apparent to us, though, and whatever their reasons for keeping him inside the wormhole, he was not the same when he returned.\u201d Some of the cadets were visibly distressed by the image on the hologram, covering their eyes with their hands, or looking down at their desks.  Wesley paused the image and brought up the first one, of a proud, strong Captain Benjamin Sisko in his Starfleet Uniform.  Wesley stood beside the hologram and said, \u201cI suggest that any of you would be lucky to be compared to the man standing before you, both in terms of service and capability.  I also suggest that if something like this can happen to him, it can happen to you.\u201d  Wesley turned the hologram off and clapped his hands together loudly, breaking the spell of despair that had fallen over his audience, \u201cOkay, now that you\u2019re all thoroughly depressed, I have some good news.  You\u2019re getting out early today.\u201d  The cadets faces instantly brightened and began to shift around in their seats to gather their things, forcing Wesley to raise his voice, \u201cThose of you taking The Test tomorrow should go home and get some rest.  In other words, don\u2019t go out to the bars.\u201d He watched as his class got up from their seats and began to file out.  For a moment, Liam O\u2019Brien stopped in his passage toward the door, looking at the professor as if he were about to say something.  Wesley turned toward the young man and said, \u201cYes?\u201d but by then, Liam had already turned away. *** The sun was setting over the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay glistened in hues of red and gold, as if the water were summoning it down to rest.  As the Academy\u2019s most senior professor, Wesley had his choice of offices.  The one with the best view also happened to be the one closest to his classroom.  He looked at the hover chair sitting in the corner of the room, the same one he\u2019d ridden in as he finally left the hospital after the Invasion and returned to the Academy.  People lined the halls as he entered, the chair whirring six inches off the ground like an elaborate flying carpet.  They welcomed him home and smiled kindly as he passed, but raw pity was evident on their faces. That day, he\u2019d stood up from the chair and refused to use it ever again. Wesley sipped the rest of his wine, red and strong to the last, then lifted the green glass bottle from his table to refill it.  The label was worn and faded now.  \u201cChateau Picard, Labarre,\u201d he whispered with a quiet nod.  Of course, the wine he was drinking had not been bottled in France.  The original bottle had been a gift from Jean-Luc many decades ago and Wesley had entered its composition into his office\u2019s food replicator.  It had been so long since he\u2019d tasted the original that he often wondered if he would even recognize it any longer.  He always refilled it in the same bottle though.  It helped support the illusion. His door beeped and Wesley set down the bottle and said, \u201cCome in.\u201d The doors whisked open instantly.  \u201cGood evening, Professor Crusher.  I hope I\u2019m not intruding on you.\u201d Wesley turned to see Liam O\u2019Brien standing in his doorway.  He held up his empty glass and said, \u201cI always enjoy a drink after teaching that particular module.  I suppose it is my attempt to gain some sort of perspective.\u201d  The cadet nodded silently, clearly he had no idea what the old man was talking about.  Wesley waved for him to come and sit and said, \u201cWhat can I do for you, Liam?\u201d \u201cTomorrow\u2019s my day.  For the test, I mean.\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d Wesley said.  \u201cAnd what have you done to prepare yourself?\u201d \u201cBesides come here, you mean?\u201d Wesley smiled softly, \u201cI am forbidden from telling you anything about the test.  Your grandfather would never forgive me.\u201d Liam held up his hand, \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant, Professor.  I just wanted someone to talk to. Someone I could trust.\u201d  He pointed at the glass in Wesley\u2019s hand and said, \u201cSomeone with a little perspective.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d Wesley said.  He eased himself down on the couch and massaged his ruined leg, grunting as he worked the tangle of muscles and cybernetics that formed his thigh and knee.   \u201cWell, when I was your age and took the test, it was still the old Klingon scenario.\u201d Liam\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cReally?\u201d Wesley nodded, \u201cSeems a little moot now, doesn\u2019t it?  I doubt any of you have ever even seen a Klingon.  Anyway, I was on the committee that proposed changing the test.  You would not believe the resistance we faced from the senior faculty.  Some traditions die harder than others.  No one wanted to admit that such an important part of their youth had become obsolete.\u201d \u201cBut you did change it, obviously,\u201d Liam said.  \u201cAll of the postings I\u2019ve seen talk about different scenarios that are randomly chosen.  It could be the Dominion, the Tholians, I guess the obvious choice is \u2026 \u201d the young man\u2019s voice trailed off. \u201cThe Borg,\u201d Wesley said quietly.  \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Liam.  You can say it around me.\u201d \u201cYes, professor,\u201d Liam said.  He looked down at his hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d"}
{"text": "  Star Trek: Icarus -1- The distraught young woman clad in a drab grey jumpsuit stepped out of the tiny automated shuttlecraft, hair in disarray from the penant-fluttering breeze, an old and durably utilitarian khaki duffel bag slung over her shoulder, and stopped and stared; she was wholly unprepared for the chaos of San Francisco\u2019s South Shuttle Terminal, and felt painfully conspicuous and out of place. She had never before felt air so humid, had never seen a place so full of colour and activity. To her eyes the intense green of the surrounding cascades of immense, towering foliage, the impossibly blue sky and the listless blue-green ocean seemed almost artificial, an assault on her senses so overwhelming that it made her feel almost physically ill. By contrast, the pale yellow skies, tan deserts, scrub plains and empty quiet of the world on she\u2019d grown up formed a serene, nostalgic contrast to the background of her thoughts. Well, she was here. Now, what? She had been found out and dismissed a matter of hours earlier from the Erbean deep-space freighter Gallant; the lie that had got her into the merchant service had also been her undoing. On her application she had claimed to be half Vulcan, half human. She was, in truth, half Vulcan, but the other half, the unruly, emotional half that tortured her with empathic feelings she wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with, was Betazoid.  She had concealed the beguiling depth of her large, dark Betazoid eyes with contacts, but a sharp-eyed shipmate, the captain\u2019s willful and manipulative concubine, Farina, had seen through the ruse and reported her. Now she was dismissed, in disgrace, and without a home.  Neither Vulcan nor Beta Zed had been an option. She couldn\u2019t tolerate the shame of being among Vulcans because of the emotions she couldn\u2019t conceal, nor could she tolerate the empathy or the open emotionalism of Betazoids, and the intolerable invasion of her own, private, personal demons. The mere thought of returning to the Federation colony where she\u2019d grown up caused her insides to feel curdled; there, for her whole entire life, she had been an unwanted outcast. Pure chance had decided her upon a nearby planet called Earth and the dubious prospect of finding some form of employment. She grimaced, inwardly. Her one real qualification for any type of work on this world was that she was relatively fluent in the widely-spoken language called English Standard, which in its earliest form had apparently originated on this strange world, though because of its uncanny flexibility it was now one of the most widely spoken languages in the Federation. The sight of the new-risen sun caused her to moan inwardly in tired frustration. By her departed ship\u2019s clock it was around 01:30 hours. This world was at least thirteen and a half hours out-of-sync with her body clock. What she needed right now, more than anything, was something familiar, or at least palatable to eat, a shower, and then bed and the forgetfulness and escape of sleep! She stared in astonishment as a woman lifted a child and held it up to what she had assumed to be some sort of local religious icon; it was a small ornate fountain with a plaque affixed to its side. The child drank her fill, the mother then held the child on her hip and did the same, and then they were off, the woman pushing the child before her in a small, lightweight, wheeled contraption.  Watching carefully for disapproving looks from the locals, she approached the fountain herself, still amazed by the sight of sparkling, free-running water. She was careful to taste it first, just to be certain that it was what it appeared to be . . . the water was good, and very cold. She drank deeply, and was soon refreshed, but the water only served to exacerbate her hunger pangs. At the entrance to the interior of the Shuttle Terminal was an icon she recognised, a small sign hanging from the ceiling with an arrow, a black silhouette of a plate with a human-style knife and fork to either side, and the words \u201cFood Court\u201d underneath in English Standard.  The Food Court was utter chaos! It was a huge open area with a domed glass roof, the entire perimeter of which was one continuous riot of mercantile food businesses. The whole entire floorspace was covered with tables and chairs, dotted with occasional litter bins, cleaning stations, and enormous live plants. Hanging from the ceiling in various places were monitors showing various types of information and entertainment. Each table had its own speaker, computer outlet and translator. And the crush of people! She had no idea that humans came in so many shapes, sizes and colours, that they spoke such a babel of disparate languages. There were many aliens as well . . . feeling ashamed, she tried not to look at anyone for fear that they would notice her own appearance in their turn. Her selection was made for her by the icons displaying which currencies and forms of credit were acceptable. The selection available to her was not great. With great reluctance, she approached a Vulcan booth, unable to look the server in the eye. To make matters worse, the woman serving her took her time, all-too-obviously scrutinizing her appearance. Feeling rattled, as though everyone were staring at her, she hastily paid the woman, moved away to an unoccupied table, ate her meal automatically and self-consciously, and went back outside. Groaning inwardly, she began pushing her way through the crush of people. Several very large shuttles had just landed, and more were high above in holding patterns. She stopped to look about for a chronometer. Someone jostled her from behind, and apologised. \u201cSorry! Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your daydreaming.\u201d Embarrassed, she found herself blocking a line of people about to board another shuttle. She noticed, then, a forty-ish man standing nearby, who gave her uniform a look, causing her to squirm involuntarily. There was no disguising a uniform stripped of insignia. To her misgiving, the man approached her. Was her presence here illegal? \u201cMay I assume that you\u2019re between commissions?\u201d Feeling very shy and intimidated, she shrugged, unable to meet his gaze, and began moving away. \u201cWe have several openings in commissary, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d The sight of his Starfleet uniform caused her to shake her head automatically. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want someone like me,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve just been dismissed.\u201d She started to turn away from him.  \u201cFor what reason?\u201d Feeling as though she were being interrogated, she bit off, tersely, \u201cBecause I had to lie to get the job I had-\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d She glared at him. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell just by looking at me? I\u2019m half Vulcan and half Betazoid! It\u2019s a poisonous mix! I\u2019m unstable! Nobody . . . wants me.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to blurt it out so bitterly, and fled, as much from him as from a premonition of the humiliating tears she couldn\u2019t control.  A hand on her arm stopped her. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d \u201cThe job\u2019s still open if you want it, young lady. I\u2019m not one to give up on people easily. And I\u2019m not one to discriminate. Working in a starship commissary is menial labour, granted, but it\u2019s still work, and well within your means if you\u2019re having any sort of personal difficulty. Besides,\u201d he added with a disarming smile, \u201cwe\u2019re desperately short on staff at the moment, and from the sound of things you\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d She eyed him, suspiciously. \u201cWhat gives you the authority to hand out positions to someone who . . . to people like me?\u201d He raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cI\u2019m the captain, which means that I can pretty much do as I please in that department.\u201d He smiled oddly at her reaction. \u201cBesides, it just so happens that I overheard your former captain\u2019s version of events when he asked for permission to release you here- it was broadcast on an open channel, so you needn\u2019t give me that look! It wasn\u2019t my intention to listen in on his conversation, though his remarks were, shall we say, revealing, to say the least-\u201d She reddened and looked away at this. \u201cLook,\u201d he said kindly, \u201cwe can offer you training courses, advancement, the beginnings of what will amount to a real career, instead of-\u201d She gave him a sharp, hostile look. \u201cWhat is it you really want?\u201d He raised an eyebrow at this, considering her. \u201cThe offer is there,\u201d he finished quietly. \u201cThe choice is yours.\u201d He glanced at the chronometer strapped to his wrist. \u201cAnd my shuttle leaves in ten minutes.\u201d He gave her a disarming smile, shrugged, spun on his heel and left her there.  She watched his receding back for a long moment, feeling as though she were foundering.  \u2013 Without breaking stride, taking in her appearance at his side with an unsurprised glance, as she almost had to run to keep up, he said, \u201cHave you any other belongings?\u201d"}
{"text": "  I AM HUGH by Jesse Booth   \u201cWe found you there, in the middle of that debris,\u201d Geordi says as he points to the remnants of the ship I crashed in. The bodies of the four other drones who were with me during the collision lay mangled on the cold, snowy mountainside, grossly disfigured. \u201cThen that is where I will wait,\u201d I reply. Geordi stays by my side as we walk to the wreckage. I am amazed that I had ever survived the crash; the damage to the ship is extensive. We come to a stop and I look at the visor hiding Geordi\u2019s eyes. The half ring allows him sight through implants embedded in his temples. Perhaps we are not all that different, Geordi and me. \u201cWell, I guess this is it, huh?\u201d he says quietly. \u201cSo long, Hugh.\u201d There is sorrow in his voice. Sorrow, because we are friends. \u201cGoodbye, Geordi. I will try to remember you.\u201d He sighs and looks down, then slowly walks a few meters away. As he turns and looks at me again, two Borg drones materialize on a ridge above us. They scan Geordi, but detect no threat and make their way towards me. They stand on either side of me, and I lift my right hand to allow for one of them to inject me back into the Collective. As I close my eyes, I feel the familiar link awaken within my mind \u2013 thousands of voices, their thoughts a part of my own. I add my voice to theirs, the memories I have collected since being removed, but I do not lose control of my newly-found sense of identity. This subtle resistance does not appear to alert the Collective. I help the drones collect parts from the deceased, and the Borg ship in the atmosphere of the moon dematerializes the remnants, transporting them up to the ship to be reabsorbed, their components to be reused by new drones. We make our way back up to the ridge and stand side-by-side, awaiting our own transportation back up to the ship. I feel the beginnings of dematerialization, and glance once more at my friend Geordi, letting him know that I am still more than just the designation Third of Five. I am Hugh. *** The small, cube-shaped vessel I materialize into is nearly identical to the ship I had been on \u2014 the same that lies in ruins on the frozen moon I just left Geordi on. A Minor Hexahedron. There are three drones already residing in interlink nodes, and the two who brought me back enter and link up inside the other chambers spread out across the walls. There is a minor difference to this ship, though. It has been modified and equipped with a sixth interlink node sitting directly in the middle of the deck, which slightly cramps the area. As I rest inside the node and interface with the link, I sense immediate confusion; the claustrophobic thought has captured the attention of the five other drones. They look at me, and I hear their voices mingling as one. <Is a sixth interlink node problematic on this vessel?> <No, it is nothing,> I assure them. <It was just an observational difference, not something to be alerted about.> The other drones seem to process my comment slowly. Their confusion compounds as they analyze my thoughts. I try to change the subject. <What is my new designation?> I ask. Their melded voices fill my mind. <You\u2019re designation as Third of Five has been terminated. A new designation will be assigned to you once we reach the nearest Mega Hexahedron.> They pause briefly as they analyze my recent memories. <You have already claimed another designation. An identification provided by Species 5618?> <Hugh>. I stumble across the name as I think it. <I am Hugh.> <We are Borg,> they say boldly. <Yes, we are Borg,> I agree. <But I am Hugh.> More analysis hits my mind. Just days ago I would have given anything to share my thoughts with the Collective once again. But this felt more like an interrogation. These thoughts and memories were mine. They should not be shared. <This drone is malfunctioning,> the drones say. <Sensors indicate new components embedded in the drone\u2019s body, as well as recent biological repair.> <Yes,> I reply. <Beverly saved my life.> <Irrelevant. You will be reabsorbed.> <I do not want to be reabsorbed,> I state. My words are reminiscent of Beverly\u2019s when she had explained that she did not want to be assimilated. <Irrelevant. Resistance is futile.> <No,> I boldly say. <Resistance is not futile.> My statement causes the other drones to falter, forcing them to reach out to the Collective for help. And that is when I feel the massive consciousness focus on me, analyzing my resistant thoughts. Why do they center their attention on me? I am but one drone on a small vessel. There are other drones elsewhere in other systems assimilating other species even now. Surely I am not more important than they. I access their thoughts and discover that this has never happened before. There has never been resistance within the Collective. Even Locutus did not resist. But I am Hugh, and I told Captain Picard that I would try to remember that fact. <Captain Picard,> the Collective says as it reads my thoughts. <You have had contact with Locutus.> <Yes.> <Even he told you resistance is futile.> <Resistance is not futile,> I reply, thinking of my conversation with the dark-skinned female on the Enterprise who came to me while I was confined behind a force field. I never did learn her identification. <Some have escaped.> <Irrelevant. They will be found. All will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.> They continue to analyze my thoughts and memories being with the humans\u2019 ship. At last, the Collective says, <You have malfunctioned. Species 5618 has corrupted your processing. Your components will be reabsorbed and distributed to maturation chambers aboard the Mega Hexahedron approaching your current trajectory.> <I do not wish to be terminated,> I reply. Emotion is a biologically based symptom of individuality. My mind is being forced to assimilate them, and the current feeling I\u2019m experiencing is unpleasant. It is the same emotion I\u2019ve witnessed on the faces of every individual of every species I have previously brought into the Collective. Fear, they call it. I hear the Collective address the other five drones surrounding me. I hear them issue the command to terminate me, to remove my components, separate the machine from the biological, and to discard my body into space. Without a second thought, the five drones step away from their nodes and approach me slowly, mechanical arms whizzing up, preparing to dismantle my components. And the emotion I had previously felt and defined as fear was but a minuscule definition of what I felt now. Terror. Terror filled my mind. Odd how an emotion can invade a mind, dashing away thought so easily. How\u2026 \u201chuman\u201d of me. Still, they circle me, and had I the capacity to think of escape options, I would react logically to the situation. But all I feel is a deep, dark terror.   ***"}

Our problem is how we get you there. It wouldn\u2019t be practical to divert the *Enterprise* all the way here for one person, and at the moment, we really don\u2019t have any vessels docked here that could cover the distance required in the time we have to get you to the rendezvous point.\u201d         \u201cI can see how that would be a problem,\u201d answered Ensign Ro Laren. \u201cHow about something that could give me a lift to someplace closer?

Even the architecture of this place brings back bad memories.\u201d         \u201cI understand. Well there\u2019s not much we can do about  the architecture, but we have some highly professional people-pleasers working here. If they can\u2019t take your mind off your troubles, no one can.\u201d         They walked together as they conversed. Presently, a second Bajoran woman approached, but she wasn\u2019t wearing a Starfleet uniform.          \u201cMajor,\u201d Sisko said. \u201cAllow me to introduce you to Ensign Ro Laren of the starship *Enterprise*. Ensign, this is my first officer, Major Kira Nerys.\u201d         Kira only nodded to Ro. \u201cCommander, we may have a ride for the ensign pulling in right now. There\u2019s an Odarian trading ship in the process of docking at upper pylon three. With a little financial incentive, there\u2019s a good chance the captain may loan it to us for the round trip.\u201d         Sisko smiled at Ro. \u201cIt may be that the Prophets have heard you.\u201d         The Odarian captain was not a pleasant sight to most humanoids, resembling a moss-covered, human-sized platypus. Roughly. It was hard to compare them to anything else in the universe.         \u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d it responded to Kira\u2019s proposal. \u201cYou want to pay me to turn my ship around and take it two weeks back in the direction I just *came* from? I\u2019d almost take you up on it, since I try to never turn down a chance to make a little extra on the side.

The biggest concern at the moment was the recent       Dominion/Cardassian alliance which threatened the alpha quadrant and       especially Bajor. Now that Bajor\u2019s deadliest enemies had joined forces, Kira\u2019s       home planet faced a very grim future indeed she thought as she sat at her post       in Ops.          Kira did not say a word to the other officers in Ops, rather she just began the       work of Deep Space Nine\u2019s commanding officer. Kira was in charge of the       station now that Captain Sisko was away overseeing repairs done on the       Defiant at Starbase 112. Neither Sisko nor his ship would be back for a week.       She missed them both.         The Defiant was one of the most powerful ships in the quadrant, and DS9       was always more vulnerable to attack when it was away, these days the       possibility of a Dominion attack seemed more and more likely. Kira also       wished that Sisko would return soon, because she hated the extra work. Fear of       Dominion attack, Dukat\u2019s recent betrayal, Odo confessing his love for her, all       this made Kira too depressed to run the station.          She was glad when Dax interrupted her and said \u201cKira, you should take a       look at this.\u201d       \u201cWhat is it Jadzia?\u201d Kira asked, as she too looked at Dax\u2019s monitor.       \u201cI am picking up a subspace echo,\u201d Dax replied \u201cIt could be anything from       natural stellar phenomena to a ship\u2019s warp signature.\u201d       \u201cWell at least it would give us something to do, let\u2019s check it out\u201d       \u201cI am getting more information now,\u201d Dax said \u201cit is definitely not natural.       Looks like a subspace transmission of some sort. It\u2019s  very weak and distorted.\u201d       \u201cCan you filter it out?\u201d Kira asked.         Instead of hearing Dax\u2019s reply, Kira heard the message itself which answered       her question. It was an automated Federation distress call, and it was so weak       it was hard to make out. But what Kira did hear troubled her.       \u201cThis is the Federation starship Barkman, we have been attacked by Jem\u2019Hdar       fighters, our main power has failed.

That was       when he had first arrived on this station, now that he was older and had       realized how dangerous the universe can be he was not so enthusiastic. In fact ,       he almost wished he was not walking to the briefing room right now.          Bashir entered the room and saw that all the other senior officers except       Sisko and O\u2019Brien were present. They all had solemn expressions on their       faces, then again there was not much to smile about these days anyway. Kira       was at the head of the table, in Sisko\u2019s absence and Bashir took his seat.       \u201cGlad to see you could make it Doctor,\u201d Kira said \u201cFifteen minutes ago we       received a distress call from the USS Barkman, they were attacked Jem\u2019Hdar"}

An exploding console had left him with second degree burns on his face, as well as one useless arm at the moment. \u201cWhere the hell is Bashir?\u201d Sisko questioned. \u201cSomebody find a medic for these people!\u201d Miles sighed and thought back to how it had all happened. Everyone had been in Quark\u2019s taking a well deserved break from the day\u2019s work. All, that is, except Julian Bashir. He had been stuck in the infirmary treating an outbreak of Andarian flu among the Bolian people. He finally staggered into the bar and plopped down in a seat about ten p.m. \u201cOh, gods, why does this always happen to me?\u201d he moaned, head in hands. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jadzia had asked. \u201cDo you want to know what I\u2019ve had to put up with today? A hysterical mother and a kid with a fractured arm, a pregnant woman going into false labor, two engineering workers falling off the Promenade rail in a drunk stupor, plus I\u2019ve had to treat all these cases of Andarian flu and I\u2019m very quickly running out of compatible medicine for the Bolians.\u201d He sighed and put his head in his arms. Jadzia looked at him in sympathy. \u201cWhat you need is a stiff drink. Unfortunately, you\u2019re a doctor so no can do. But I\u2019ll buy you a synthale anyway.\u201d He looked at her gratefully. \u201cMiles, come on. We\u2019ve got to get to Ops,\u201d she said after awhile. \u201cAll right. See you, Julian.\u201d Julian smiled tiredly and stood up to go back to the infirmary. It was at that moment that they were attacked. \u201cWhat the-?\u201d Miles wondered and stood up, racing to ops with Jadzia. \u201cSir, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he yelled when he reached Sisko. \u201cThe Klingons have hit us. They decloaked off port side of upper pylon three. Then they hit us. Miles, I want you to get to the console and see if you can get us some more power to the shields. Dax, start helping Kira get those weapons back on line. Bashir-where is Doctor Bashir?\u201d They all looked around, but he was not there. \u201cHe must be in the infirmary,\u201d Miles said. \u201cJulian, can you hear me? Julian, where are you? Computer, locate Doctor Bashir.\u201d \u201cDoctor Bashir is in the infirmary.\u201d \u201cDax, you get a team to find him. There are going to be dead people here soon if we don\u2019t have a doctor here,\u201d Sisko commanded. \u201cAye, sir. Rogers, Johnson, Smith, you\u2019re with me.\u201d They raced out of ops in the direction of the turbolift. \u201cPromenade,\u201d she commanded. Miles sighed and worked at getting the weapons systems back online. The blast from the console had given him the burns that were making every movement feel like agony. \u201cO\u2019Brien, how are you coming along?\u201d Sisko asked, his voice strained. \u201cJust a few more seconds, sir.\u201d He punched the last command in. \u201cThere, do it! It\u2019s up!\u201d The commbadge chirped. \u201cBenjamin, we can\u2019t find Julian. His communicator\u2019s here, but he\u2019s not.\u201d"}
